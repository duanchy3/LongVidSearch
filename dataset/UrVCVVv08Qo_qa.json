Step 2: Slice 42 shows '30 MINUTES LATER' and then a tractor driving down the same snowy road, indicating help arriving. The logic holds because the earlier scene shows the car stuck and the later scene shows a tractor arriving, which aligns with the proposed answer that a tractor arrived due to the car being stuck in deep snow.",

Step 4: The same long-haired interviewee describes a severe accident-related medical episode (including weeks unconscious), reinforcing the cautionary angle.

Step 2: Slices 23 and 25 show the long-haired man in a red-and-white plaid shirt being interviewed at a table in a kitchen/dining or home-like room with a coat rack and door visible. Step 3: Slice 24 connects his story to a medical setting, where subtitles state doctors advised the patient not to go to the sauna again, implying a cautionary outcome related to health issues. Logic holds because the long-haired man in a red plaid shirt is consistently depicted across slices, and the documentary-style edit ties his interview to the medical warning.",
