Step 2: Slice 9 shows infrastructure labels including 'Oslo Lufthavn Gardermoen' (Oslo Airport) and 'Port of Oslo'. Logic holds because both slices refer to Oslo and connect the capital marking to later infrastructure depictions.",

In Clip 2, starting at 0:00, the video zooms into Oslo, and subsequent frames (0:02-0:06) label key infrastructure with text overlays such as 'OSLO LUFTHAVN, GARDERMOEN' and 'PORT OF OSLO', confirming the city's identity and its major facilities."

Step 2: Slice 16 later references Svalbard near the North Pole, explicitly mentions 110 days of polar night, and highlights the Svalbard Seed Vault as a global seed preservation facility. Logic holds because the same archipelago is described with the specific attributes asked: unincorporated status and small seasonal population, and later connected to polar night and the global seed vault.",
        "visual_proof": "The video explicitly labels the archipelago as 'SVALBARD (Unincorporated)' at 0:04 and shows its seasonal population ('~40 (WINTER)', '~120 (SUMMER)') at 0:07. Later, it visually connects Svalbard to the 'polar night' with text showing '110 Days' of darkness at 0:23 and then introduces the 'Svalbard Seed Vault' with images of its exterior and interior at 0:26-0:28."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 26 states that during an aerial view of snowy mountains, the word 'GALDHOPIGGEN' appears on screen, identifying the mountain shown. Step 2: Slice 25 describes a geography map that includes labels such as 'Alpine Boreal Climate' and features like 'Scandinavian Mountains' and 'Steep Jagged Cliffs and Fjords,' confirming the map shows Norway’s alpine/boreal climate and mountainous terrain. The visual evidence supports that the mountain name is Galdhøpiggen, and the map segment includes the referenced climate and terrain labels.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the name 'GALDHØPIGGEN' is clearly displayed over a snowy mountain landscape. In Video 2, while Norway's geography is shown, labels for 'ALPINE BOREAL CLIMATE' and 'FJORDS' appear, which are associated with the mountainous terrain where Galdhøpiggen is located, confirming the context of the question."
