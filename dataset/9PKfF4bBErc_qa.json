Step 2: Slice 78 explicitly shows a title card stating 'THIS IS MY 7 MONTH ASIAN ODYSSEY.' Logic holds because the question asks for the two month counts from these separate title cards, which are 8 and 7 respectively.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, at 0:01, a black screen displays the text '8 MONTHS'. In Video 2, at 0:06, a title card over a plane wing shot reads 'THIS IS MY 7 MONTH ASIAN ODYSSEY'. Both pieces of text are clearly visible and legible in their respective clips."

Step 3: Slice 63 shows close-up handling of a small object (like jewelry/toy). Conclusion: Across time, he continues a hands-on unboxing/inspection activity.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 3 shows the man at a table holding a small box while speaking, implying he is introducing or focusing on that boxed item. Step 2: Slice 62, in the same living room setup (laptop, green bottle, sofa, guitar), shows him actively manipulating small items on the table, possibly assembling/disassembling, which continues the hands-on engagement with objects. Step 3: Slice 63 shows him later handling a small object in a bedroom-like setting, examining/manipulating it, with a similar green bottle visible, indicating continued work with small items. Logic holds because the progression from holding a small box to handling small objects suggests an ongoing hands-on segment where he examines items, plausibly following an unboxing or item handling flow.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows the man holding and presenting a small grey box. Clip 2 shows him at the same table, now interacting with his laptop while the box sits beside it, implying a transition in activity. Clip 3 is a close-up of his hands holding and examining a very small object, consistent with handling an item from the box. The continuity of location (same desk, background) and the progression from a larger package to smaller components support the conclusion that he is engaged in a hands-on unboxing or review segment."

Step 3: Slice 71 shows a purple bicycle as a wireframe in 3D modeling software, with the presenter explaining, suggesting creation/refinement of a 3D asset. Logic holds because the same purple bicycle motif consistently appears across a logo animation, mobile display, and 3D modeling context, implying a workflow from branding to mobile representation to 3D asset work.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows the final animated logo with the name 'CHRISTIAN LEBLANC'. Clip 2 and 3 show this same logo displayed on a smartphone screen, indicating its use in a mobile context. Clip 4 shows a file browser with numerous PSD files (a common graphic design format) named 'BIKE' and a video file titled 'Bike FCPX.mov', suggesting the creation or editing of the bicycle asset in design software. This sequence visually supports a workflow from animation to mobile display to asset creation/refinement."

Step 3: Slice 61 shows the creator in a different scene wearing a gray hoodie in a living room setting, presented as a YouTube video titled \"MY BIG SECRET,\" indicating a distinct recording. Step 4: Slice 53 presents a split-screen: on the left, a man in a car wearing a light gray hoodie; on the right, a man in a white T-shirt working at a desk. The contrast in clothing and settings across these slices supports that the footage comes from different segments/sessions rather than one continuous take.",

Clip 2 and Clip 3 show him in a gray hoodie, first inside a car and then in a kitchen setting. The distinct changes in clothing and background environments across the clips strongly indicate that these are separate recording sessions."
