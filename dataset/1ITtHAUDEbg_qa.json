        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 22 describes an emotional singing segment with a female performer, and explicitly notes that one of the seated male performers is holding a purple flower. Step 2: Slice 29 shows a male central figure on stage holding a purple microphone, indicating the microphone color becomes prominent later. The details align logically across the slices and directly support both parts of the proposed answer.",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 12 describes a woman with a microphone leading an interview/talk segment, with the audience shown clapping and cheering enthusiastically. This supports that the main activity during the initial audience clapping is a live talk/interview segment. Step 2: Slice 52 shows a sequence where a man performs (singing) and, upon finishing, the audience applauds. This connects the earlier audience reaction to a later moment of applause at the end of a musical performance. The proposed answer aligns with both slices: initial clapping during a live stage talk/performance segment and later applause when the performer finishes.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (0:07-0:08) and Clip 2 (0:06-0:08), the audience is shown clapping enthusiastically while the host and performers are on stage. In Clip 2 (0:16-0:22), a performer sings into a microphone during what is clearly a musical performance, with lyrics displayed on screen. The context of the show '이효리의 레드카펫' (Lee Hyori's Red Carpet) and the group ENHYPEN suggests this is a performance event. The applause from the audience in both clips serves as a reaction to the ongoing stage activities, connecting the talk segment to the musical performance."

Step 2: Slice 44 states that a later stage performance by a dance group has a large circular screen showing the same title '이효리의 레드카펫.' Logic holds because both slices show the same event title on the backdrop in two different segments (an interview-like segment and a choreography performance), directly supporting the proposed connection.",

Step 3: Evidence Slice 83 states the stage design 'includes circular structures' during a dance performance, confirming the recurrence of circular elements. The proposed answer names the three contexts accordingly: behind the ENHYPEN branding, behind the talk-show/event title backdrop, and in later dance stages with circular light patterns. The logic holds because each slice independently supports a circular stage/backdrop element in distinct contexts.",
