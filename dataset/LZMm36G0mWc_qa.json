        "question": "A historical statue on horseback is shown early with an identifying sign, and later the video returns to a similar horseback statue at night with visitors photographing it. What is the name of the figure associated with the horseback statue across these moments?",

Conclusion: The horseback statue is associated with Date Masamune.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 3 explicitly shows a samurai on horseback with a sign reading 'Date Masamune 1567-1636,' identifying the statue. Step 2: Slice 87 later shows a horseback statue at night with on-screen text referencing 'Masamune,' aligning with the earlier identification. Logic holds because both moments reference a horseback statue tied to Masamune, with the first giving the full name 'Date Masamune' and the second reinforcing it.",
        "visual_proof": "In the first clip, text on screen explicitly identifies the statue as 'Date Masamune' with his lifespan (1567-1636) and his Japanese name '伊達政宗'. The second clip shows the same statue at night, confirming it is the same subject. The subtitles in the second clip also refer to 'Masamune', directly linking the name to the statue being photographed."

        "question": "A gift from Masamune to a shogun is shown as a specific food item, and elsewhere a quote connects cooking ability with character. What is the gift, and what virtue is implied by the quote about cooking?",
