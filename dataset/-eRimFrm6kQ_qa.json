Step 2: Slice 14 later highlights 'Aldabra Atoll' as a notable natural place in the Seychelles tour montage. Logic holds because the question asks for the islands labeled in the map segment (Slice 9) and the specific atoll highlighted later (Slice 14), both of which match the proposed answer.",

Step 2: Slice 49 describes a later segment with a woman teaching and showing French phrases on screen such as 'Le pain' and 'Il/elle est grand/grande,' which reinforces the French component.

Step 3: Evidence Slice 35 explicitly notes a transition from cultural/cuisine scenes to a 'DEMOGRAPHICS' graphic, reinforcing the shift.

        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually presents a montage of cultural and tourist landmarks such as 'THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART', 'ST ANNE NATIONAL MARINE PARK', 'CATHEDRAL OF OUR LADY IMMACULATE CONCEPTION', and 'NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM'. Clip 3 then transitions to a data-focused segment titled 'SEYCHELLES DEMOGRAPHICS', displaying population figures (96,762 people) and a detailed pie chart breaking down ethnic percentages (e.g., 85-90% Seychelle Creole, 6% Indo-Seychellois). This clear visual progression from scenic/cultural sites to statistical data confirms the shift described in the answer."
