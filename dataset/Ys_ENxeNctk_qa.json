Step 2: Slice 11 explicitly shows a labeled close-up stating 'Summer snow has smaller flakes.' Step 3: The scenes depict different materials used in demonstrations, but the proposed answer focuses on the stated difference, which is directly supported by both slices. Therefore, the context fully supports the answer that winter snow has larger flakes and summer snow has smaller flakes.",

Since the man in the red plaid shirt appears first in the video but is never shown in the academic setting, and the man in the green plaid shirt appears later and is only shown in the academic setting, neither presenter fits the description perfectly.
