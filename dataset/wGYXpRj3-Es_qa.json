Step 2: Slice 85 shows a communal outdoor table with children seated, and explicitly mentions two bowls filled with slices of watermelon in the center of the table. Logic holds because the fruit is first prepared (Slice 80) and then appears on the communal table with the children (Slice 85), matching the proposed answer.",

The final shot of Clip 1 shows two bowls filled with these sliced watermelons arranged in a flower pattern.

Step 2: Slice 83 shows a cooked bean-and-meat mixture being scooped from a pot and served onto a wooden plate in the same outdoor rustic setup.

This action occurs after the meat has been cut into pieces. In Video 2 (0:00-0:01), a close-up shows red pepper flakes being sprinkled onto the meat, which happens after the salt has already been applied.

Step 3: Slice 32 explicitly states it is nighttime; a man exits a cabin and goes to a fire pit where meat is hanging from branches, and he inspects/adjusts the meat, i.e., tending the same type of setup.

Step 3: Slice 29 shows hot liquid being poured from a kettle into a glass and stirred, with steam visible, and Slice 30 shows the man sipping a hot beverage after heating a pot/kettle over a fire.

Step 3: Slice 20 explicitly shows a makeshift wooden structure made from branches used to hang meat over a fire, and the man later adds more branches and foliage to enhance the smoking process, possibly to increase smoke or create a controlled environment. Logic holds because the context demonstrates a transition from a basic branch/foliage structure to its active use in smoking meat, including adjustments with foliage to control smoke while meat hangs above the fire.",

Clip 2 shows him hanging raw meat on a crossbar of this structure over a fire pit, establishing its use for smoking. Clip 3 visually confirms the evolution: he gathers large amounts of green foliage and drapes it over the top and sides of the tripod, effectively enclosing the meat and fire to trap and direct smoke, which is the key step in the smoking process."
