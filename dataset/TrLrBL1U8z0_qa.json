        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 49 shows a black screen with the label \"GPL CODE,\" introducing a license category. Step 2: Slice 50 describes the presenter in front of a computer screen displaying the full text of the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3). Logic holds because the label \"GPL CODE\" precedes and aligns with the later display of the GPL-3 text.",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 31 explicitly states the slide title is 'Scope of Copyright Protection' and describes its content, confirming the first part of the answer. Step 2: Slice 41 shows the presenter discussing a Wikipedia page titled 'Derivative work,' which is directly related to a component mentioned on the slide (derivative works), supporting the claim that he expands the topic using that page. Logic holds because the slide includes derivative works within the scope of protection and the later segment focuses on the 'Derivative work' Wikipedia page.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually displays a slide with the exact title \"Scope of Copyright Protection\" while the presenter speaks. Clip 2 visually displays a Wikipedia page with the exact title \"Derivative work\" while the same presenter continues speaking, indicating a direct topical expansion from the first slide's content."

Step 2: Slice 77 describes a man showing and discussing an Engadget article specifically about Amazon using algorithms to fire Flex drivers. Logic holds because the first visual introduces the topic with an Amazon building, and the later visual directly supports the claim with the Engadget article on the same topic.",

Step 2: Evidence Slice 6 explicitly shows 'Tabnine' with the text 'Code faster with AI code completions.' Logic holds because these are two distinct AI coding assistants shown in separate slices, each labeled with the specified phrases.",

Step 2: Slice 78 shows the same style presenter (sunglasses, black shirt) with on-screen text 'TensorFlow decision forests' and a description of decision forest algorithms, evidencing a shift to decision-forest machine learning. Step 3: Slice 79 presents a visual example labeled 'EXAMPLES' with multiple decision trees ('Tree 1', 'Tree 2', 'Tree n') and a line labeled 'VOTING,' which is a clear depiction used to explain decision forests. The visual attributes are consistent across slices, satisfying the instruction to handle naming/scene continuity.",
