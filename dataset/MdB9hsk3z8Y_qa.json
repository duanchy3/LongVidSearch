        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 7 describes a digital map labeled with \"Detroit\" and \"Windsor,\" indicating the Detroit–Windsor area, with a river and bridges, establishing the geographic context. Step 2: Slice 12 explicitly identifies the aerial view as Belle Isle, a large island in the Detroit River between Detroit and Windsor, described as a park-like space. Logic holds because the question asks which island is shown in the Detroit–Windsor area map and then as an aerial island park; Slice 12 directly names Belle Isle in that exact location.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays a map of the Detroit-Windsor area with 'Belle Isle' clearly labeled in the middle of the river. Clip 2 shows an aerial view of a large, park-like island situated between two urban areas, consistent with the geography shown in Clip 1. The name 'Belle Isle' is visible on the map in Clip 1, directly identifying the island shown in Clip 2."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 21 describes a riverfront steel truss bridge walkway, establishing the bridge/river context early in the video. Step 2: Slice 24 later shows a sports facility near the river with a bridge visible, and explicitly identifies it as a baseball stadium, detailing the field, seating, scoreboard, and other baseball-specific features. Logic holds because the later scene clearly highlights a baseball stadium in the riverfront setting connected by bridges, matching the question's description of a sports island setting.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a pedestrian truss bridge over a river, establishing the riverfront setting. Clip 2 provides an aerial view of a large, well-maintained green field with a distinct diamond-shaped infield, pitcher's mound, and surrounding bleachers and fencing, which are all characteristic features of a baseball stadium. The stadium is situated on land adjacent to a wide river, connected by bridges visible in the background, matching the description of a 'sports island'."

Step 2: Slice 46 describes a large brown bear and explicitly states that on-screen text shows the bear's weight range as '(300-600kg)'. The proposed answer '300–600 kg' matches the displayed range in Slice 46. The logic holds because the sequence described in the question aligns with the slices, and the weight range is explicitly provided.",
