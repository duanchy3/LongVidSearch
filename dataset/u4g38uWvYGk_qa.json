Step 2: Slice 5 mentions a comparison of sugar concentrations (\"20%\" and \"50%\" sugar) and explains that bigger bees focused on more rewarding flowers. Therefore, the smaller bees treating all flowers equally implies they are ignoring these reward differences, specifically the 20% vs 50% sugar comparison. Logic holds because Slice 5 provides the context of varying rewards and Slice 6 states smaller bees' indifference.",
