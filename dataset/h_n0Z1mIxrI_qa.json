        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 2 describes a group unloading a large log from a truck and placing it on the ground in a rural outdoor setting. Step 2: Slice 8 shows a man in an outdoor natural setting cutting a large log on the ground using a chainsaw. Logic holds because both slices depict a large log on the ground in a consistent outdoor environment, and Slice 8 explicitly identifies the tool used to cut the log as a chainsaw.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a group of men is seen unloading a large log from a truck. In Video 2, the same log is shown on the ground, and a man is preparing to cut it with an orange and white chainsaw, which he then uses. The context implies this is the same log being processed after unloading."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 57 states the video shows a black and white cat lying on the ground next to a large log. Logic holds because both slices identify the animal as a black-and-white cat in the two described contexts, matching the question’s scenes. Even if the exact order may vary, the identification of the animal is clear.",

Step 2: Slice 79 shows a man cooking in a large cast-iron pan with sliced vegetables including bell peppers and pieces of meat, and he stirs and mixes them as steam rises, indicating a hot pan. Logic holds because the later scene clearly uses bell peppers in a hot pan mixed with other vegetables and meat, matching the described action of adding and stirring. While the answer mentions a 'wok,' the context specifies a pan; the core action (adding sliced peppers and mixing/stir-frying with other ingredients) is supported.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows green peppers being harvested into a woven basket. Clip 2 shows the same person cooking in a large pan/wok outdoors, where sliced green peppers (identifiable by color and shape) are visibly mixed with chunks of meat, tomatoes, onions, and other vegetables, indicating they were incorporated into a stir-fry or sauté dish."

Step 2: Slice 25 describes an underwater fish scene followed by a white dog standing on grass near a house with a wooden exterior. Logic holds because the first part identifies the two animals playing, and the second part shows a white dog (consistent with one of the two) appearing alone after the underwater scene near a wooden house.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, two dogs are visible in the garden: one is larger, primarily white with black patches, and the other is smaller, mostly black with a distinct brown face.

In Clip 3, immediately following this, he is shown taking a raw chicken out of the basket and placing it on the wooden cutting board on the table. The use of the blowtorch on the chicken is shown in Clip 2, which occurs after the chicken has been placed on the table. This sequence confirms that placing the chicken on the table happens between bringing the basket to the table and using the blowtorch."
