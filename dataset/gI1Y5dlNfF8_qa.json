        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 6 describes a quilt with a central star-like pattern and explicitly states the background is a rich, textured purple fabric. Step 2: Slice 7 describes another star quilt and explicitly states the background is vibrant green. Logic holds because both slices refer to distinct quilts with star designs and clearly specify their background colors as purple and green respectively.",
        "visual_proof": "The first video clip clearly displays a quilt with a prominent star design set against a solid purple, textured background. The second video clip shows a different quilt, also featuring a star design, but this one is set against a bright green, textured background. The colors are distinct and directly observable in each respective clip."

Conclusion: The Met is the exhibition venue and Joslyn is an explicitly credited image source.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 1 states the exhibition 'Karl Bodmer's North American Portraits' is at The Met Fifth Avenue, identifying The Metropolitan Museum of Art as the associated museum at the start.

Logic holds because the first part identifies the hosting museum and the second part identifies a museum credited for images.",
        "visual_proof": "At 0:02 in Clip 1, the text states the exhibition 'Karl Bodmer: North American Portraits' is 'On view at The Met Fifth Avenue'. At 0:04 in Clip 2, the credits list 'Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha, NE' under 'Images courtesy of'."
