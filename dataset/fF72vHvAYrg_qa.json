        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 2 describes the early part of the video where a man walks along a rural path and passes cows, as well as more animals such as sheep and goats. Step 2: Slice 30 describes later scenes showing a black calf behind a metal grid and a brown calf in a rustic wooden structure/shed. Logic holds because the early animals (cows, sheep, goats) match Slice 2, and the later animals (calves, one black and one brown, in the specified enclosures) match Slice 30.",

Step 2: Slice 17 explicitly states the man is \"placing his hand gently on the boy's head,\" another distinct comforting gesture. Logic holds because both slices describe similar characters and setting (outdoor, lush greenery; boy in black with green accents; man in dark outerwear), and they each clearly document different physical gestures—shoulder touch vs. head touch—across separate moments.",

Step 2: Slice 40 describes a person tending a campfire by placing and adjusting wood and embers in a fire pit, which constitutes preparing the fuel for the cooking setup. Logic holds because the earlier action of arranging wood in the fire directly supports the later scene of cooking over that fire.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a person is shown crouching next to a fire pit with a metal grate. They are actively placing and adjusting pieces of split wood onto the existing embers and small flames, which is the preparation of fuel for cooking. This action occurs before the scene in Video 2, where the pot with onions and carrots is already being stirred over the established fire."
