        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 4 explicitly states that a person draws an oval and inside the oval they draw a pair of scissors, confirming the tool drawn is scissors. Step 2: Evidence Slice 31 describes a baking tray with caramel sauce and later shows hands using a knife to cut through the caramel on the tray, confirming the kitchen step involves cutting caramel. Logic holds because the first part references the drawing activity and the second part references the kitchen scene, both directly supported by the respective slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a hand draws a pair of scissors inside a large oval on a sketchpad. In Clip 2, a person uses a knife to cut a hardened, sticky, amber-colored substance (visually consistent with caramel) on a parchment-lined baking tray."

Step 2: Slice 64 describes a presentation titled 'Alvin's Yeti Meal.' Logic holds because the question asks for the two 'Yeti Meal' titles shown near the end, and these two slices provide those exact titles.",

Step 2: Slice 63 ends with the on-screen title \"RIE'S YETI MEAL,\" identifying one plated dish. Step 3: Slice 64 presents \"Alvin's Yeti Meal\" as another titled plated dish. Logic holds because the context provides the outcome announcement and the two titled dishes connected to the Yeti-themed judging.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with a title card reading 'And the Winner is...'. Clip 2 immediately follows, showing a plated dish with the on-screen text 'RIE'S YETI MEAL'. Clip 3 then shows another plated dish with the on-screen text 'ALVIN'S YETI MEAL'. The sequence visually confirms the connection between the announcement and the two specific meals."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 13 says the man in a green apron is cutting/squeezing a lime into a blender, indicating a blender is used early to combine ingredients. Step 2: Slice 27 says the man pours a liquid from a blue pot onto skewers on a baking tray, described as a yellowish sauce or marinade. Logic holds because both slices feature the same kitchen context with the man in a green apron, and they explicitly describe the blender use early and the later pouring of sauce from a pot onto skewers.",
        "visual_proof": "In the first clip, a man is seen adding chopped green ingredients into a clear blender. In the second clip, a close-up shows a hand pouring a thick, brownish sauce from a blue pot onto wooden skewers arranged on a parchment-lined baking tray."
