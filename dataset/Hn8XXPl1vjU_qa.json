Conclusion: The replacement label is \"Germans,\" and the later speaker by the Polish flag is the red polo presenter.",

Step 2: Evidence Slice 7 shows the man in the red polo shirt speaking with the Polish flag visible on screen.

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 31 shows a sequence including wildlife images culminating in a close-up of a bear, setting up relevance to a bear. Step 2: Slice 32 explicitly identifies the bear as Wojtek via the hashtag and narration, establishing the bear’s name. Step 3: Slice 32 describes archival footage of Wojtek standing next to two soldiers operating a mortar in a forested, WWII wartime setting, confirming he is shown with soldiers in a wartime context. Therefore, the answer aligns with the provided evidence.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 2, the first frame shows a black-and-white photo of a large bear sitting in a trench with two soldiers operating a mortar, clearly indicating a wartime setting. The subsequent frames show the same man from Video 1, who then points to a picture with the hashtag '#Wojtek', explicitly naming the bear. This visual evidence directly supports the claim that the bear's name is Wojtek and that he was associated with soldiers during wartime."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 4 describes the video opening with a globe and the words 'POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY' in bold green letters, indicating an earlier title card introducing the previous geography topic. Logic holds because both slices refer to the same presentation style (man in red polo against a black background) and clearly identify the titles of the segments.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with a title card displaying \"POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\" over a globe. Clip 2 concludes with a title card displaying \"PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\" over an animated island scene, immediately following segments about Polish castles. This sequence visually confirms the transition between the two topics as stated."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 43 explicitly states that after the dramatic impact, the scene cuts to the man in the red shirt standing alone against the black background. Step 2: Slice 44 shows the red polo presenter in front of a black background and mentions an inset image, but the question asks about immediately afterward, which Slice 43 covers. The description of the red polo presenter being alone is directly supported. Naming aligns (man in red shirt vs red polo presenter).",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, after the gray-shirt character attacks with claws and a bright flash occurs (0:04-0:05), the scene cuts to the red polo presenter standing alone against the black background at 0:06. This visual evidence directly supports the claim that he is shown alone afterward."
