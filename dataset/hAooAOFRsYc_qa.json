Step 2: Evidence Slice 43 shows comparison graphs where the blue line labeled 'Softmax Attention' exhibits quadratic scaling in both memory and time with sequence length. Logic holds because the mechanism introduced in Slice 20 (softmax attention) is the same one shown to scale quadratically in Slice 43.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually highlights the term 'softmax' in Equation 2 and its description as a specific form of self-attention. Clip 2, in Figure 1, explicitly states in its caption that 'softmax... scales with the square of the sequence length both in memory and time,' which is the definition of quadratic scaling. The red dashed line labeled 'softmax' in both graphs also visually demonstrates this steeper, non-linear growth compared to the linear models."

Step 2: Slice 43 also mentions a PyTorch reimplementation of the Reformer model, reinforcing the context. Step 3: Slice 47 shows results tables listing methods 'LSH-1' and 'LSH-4' among others. Step 4: The naming 'lsh-X' in Slice 43 logically corresponds to the LSH-1/LSH-4 entries in Slice 47 as LSH-based variants, aligning with the highlighted Reformer (lsh-X). Therefore, the item highlighted is the Reformer LSH-based variant, which appears again in the tables as LSH-1/LSH-4.",
