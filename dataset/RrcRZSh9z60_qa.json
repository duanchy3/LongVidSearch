        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 11 explicitly states the title screen displays 'Ted Bundy Executed' with the date, confirming the execution title. Step 2: Slice 30 describes an elderly man in a courtroom wearing a black robe, noting this suggests he may be a judge or legal authority. The robed man therefore appears to be a judge. The logic aligns directly with the provided slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 clearly displays a title card with the text \"Ted Bundy Executed\" dated \"JAN 24, 1989.\" Clip 2 shows an older man wearing traditional black judicial robes and glasses, seated at a high bench in what appears to be a courtroom, which is consistent with the role of a judge presiding over a case."

        "question": "A segment highlights an NFL milestone about a coach, and another segment highlights a running back’s first NFL game. What milestone is mentioned, and which player’s first game is featured?",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 80 explicitly shows a title card stating \"First Black NFL Coach\" dated Oct 3, 1989, confirming the milestone about a coach. Step 2: Evidence Slice 72 explicitly shows a graphic reading \"Barry Sanders First NFL Game\" dated Sep 10, 1989, and depicts Barry Sanders with the Detroit Lions, confirming the running back’s first NFL game. Logic holds because both parts of the proposed answer directly match the captions in the respective slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 explicitly displays a title card reading 'First Black NFL Coach' with the date 'OCT 3, 1989'. Clip 2 displays a title card reading 'Barry Sanders First NFL Game' with the date 'SEP 10, 1989'. These text overlays directly confirm the milestones mentioned in the question."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 9 explicitly states that the painting 'Portrait de Paul Éluard' is attributed to Salvador Dalí, identifying the surrealist artist. Step 2: Evidence Slice 7 shows a dated card reading 'Salvador Dali Dies' with a date, marking the death of the same named artist. Logic holds because both slices reference Salvador Dalí directly, tying him to both the painting and the death announcement.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a painting titled 'Portrait de Paul Éluard' and, in a separate graphic, a card that reads 'Salvador Dali Dies' with the date 'JAN 23, 1989'. Clip 2 reinforces this by showing the same 'Salvador Dali Dies' card with his image. The consistent attribution of the death announcement to Salvador Dalí, paired with the display of his artwork, visually confirms he is the artist tied to both events."

Bush Takes Office' on January 20, 1989, with an image of him raising his hand in an oath-taking gesture. Step 2: Slice 6 describes a similar outdoor ceremony where a man at a podium raises his right hand while taking an oath. Logic holds because the title card explicitly names George H.W. Bush, and the later scene repeats the oath-taking gesture—raising the right hand.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 contains a title card that explicitly reads 'George H.W. Bush Takes Office' dated Jan 20, 1989. Clip 2 visually shows George H.W. Bush in an outdoor ceremony, raising his right hand in the act of taking an oath, which is the same gesture implied by the title card."

Step 2: Slice 30 describes an elderly man in a black robe in a courtroom, suggesting he is a judge, which matches 'a judge in a robe.' Logic holds because the sentence is directly stated in Slice 44 and the courtroom authority figure is clearly depicted in Slice 30.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 2 explicitly displays the text 'SENTENCE: 120 hours community service' over a shot of the courtroom. Clip 3 shows an elderly man wearing a black judicial robe, sitting at a bench in a courtroom setting, which visually identifies him as a judge."
