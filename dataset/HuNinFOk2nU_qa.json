Step 2: Slice 67 reinforces the same action—steady, precise chopping of the small mozzarella pieces on a cutting board. Step 3: Slice 80 shows the assembly of an eggplant-and-tomato dish, where small balls of mozzarella are placed on top of the tomatoes. Logic holds because the sequence of preparing mozzarella (cutting) is followed by using mozzarella as a topping in the eggplant-and-tomato assembly. The slight description difference (pieces vs small balls) does not break the sequence of preparation then topping use.",
