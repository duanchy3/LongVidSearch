    "question": "What well-known saying about pictures appears on a slide, and later what opposite phrasing about words appears on another slide?",

    "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 2 shows the slide text \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\" Step 2: Slice 3 shows a different slide reading \"A word is worth a thousand pictures.\" Conclusion: The presentation contrasts the two sayings across the two moments.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 2 explicitly states the slide text reads \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\" Step 2: Slice 3 explicitly states another slide’s title reads \"A word is worth a thousand pictures.\" Logic holds because both slices depict the same setting (man in blue shirt, American flag, presentation), indicating two slides from the same talk; the answer repeats exactly those phrases.",
    "visual_proof": "In the first clip, the slide clearly displays the text 'A picture is worth a thousand words.' In the second clip, the slide shows the text 'A word is worth a thousand pictures.', which is the opposite phrasing as stated in the question."

    "question": "Which slide about detecting objects shows a collage of airplanes, and later which slide shows a page filled with motorcycle images?",
    "answer": "The collage of airplanes appears on the \"Airplanes\" slide, and the motorcycle page appears on the \"Motor Cycles\" slide.",

    "hop_level": "2-Hop",
    "evidence_slices": [

    ],
    "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 22 includes a slide titled \"Airplanes\" with many airplane images. Step 2: Slice 23 shows a slide titled \"Motor Cycles\" filled with motorcycle images. Conclusion: The talk cycles through object-category detection examples, including airplanes and motorcycles.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 22 explicitly describes a slide titled 'Airplanes' that shows a collage of various airplane images arranged in a grid. Step 2: Slice 23 explicitly describes a slide titled 'Motor Cycles' displaying various images of motorcycles. Logic holds because the question asks which slides correspond to these visuals; the titles 'Airplanes' and 'Motor Cycles' directly match the described content.",
    "visual_proof": "In Video 1, at timestamp 0:20, a slide titled \"Airplanes\" is displayed, which contains a grid of nine images, all featuring different types of airplanes. In Video 2, at timestamp 0:00, a slide titled \"Motor Cycles\" is shown, displaying a similar grid of nine images, all of which are motorcycles. The titles and content of the slides directly match the description in the original answer."

    "answer": "The UCF Sports Action Dataset slide states 9 actions in 142 videos, and the later grid slide is the UCF YouTube Action Dataset (UCF-11) / UCF50 slide with thumbnails.",

Step 2: Slice 39 shows a grid for \"UCF YouTube Action Dataset (UCF-11)\" and \"UCF50.\" Conclusion: The talk moves from one action dataset summary to another dataset’s thumbnail grid.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 36 explicitly states the slide titled 'UCF Sports Action Dataset' mentions '9 different actions captured in 142 videos.' Step 2: Slice 39 describes a slide titled 'UCF50' and 'UCF YouTube Action Dataset (UCF-11)' showing a grid of action thumbnails. Logic holds because the first part directly matches Slice 36, and the second part directly matches Slice 39's description of the UCF YouTube Action Dataset grid.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 clearly shows a slide titled 'UCF Sports Action Dataset' with the text '9 actions, 142 videos.' below it. Clip 2 first displays a grid labeled 'UCF50' and then transitions to another grid labeled 'UCF YouTube Action Dataset (UCF-11)', both of which show multiple action thumbnails, confirming the description in the original answer."
