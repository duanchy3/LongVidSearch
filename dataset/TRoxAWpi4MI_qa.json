        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 63 shows bowls being placed on a surface with a text overlay stating their bases are wider than those of Japanese bowls, visually demonstrating the feature. Step 2: Slice 64 includes a man verbally explaining to a visitor that the base of the (Okinawan) bowl is wider than that of Japanese bowls. Logic holds because both slices present the same detail—wider bases—first via demonstration/text and then via verbal explanation, explicitly tied to Okinawan bowls in Slice 64.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, after a bowl is shaped on the wheel and placed on a wooden board next to another, a subtitle appears stating, 'The base is wider than that of Japanese bowls.' In Clip 2, the same subtitle is shown while the potter is speaking to a visitor, visually reinforcing this point as he gestures towards the bowls. The visual action of placing the bowl and the verbal explanation are directly linked by the identical subtitle, confirming the detail about the wider base."

Step 2: Slice 67 states a common shape spans southern China to Vietnam. Step 3: Slice 68 has speakers discussing island connections with the continent while in a pottery studio. Step 4: Slice 57 summarizes the theme as feeling connections between cultures. Conclusion: Verbal claims and design-shape comparisons jointly support the broader-Asia connection.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 55 explicitly quotes a speaker describing the pottery as \"rustic but dignified and refined\" with \"a continental feel,\" which supports the idea of rustic character and connection to a broader (continental) context. Step 2: Evidence Slice 67 shows a craftsperson stating, \"This is a common shape in Asia from southern China to Vietnam,\" providing a concrete design example that ties the pottery form to broader Asia. The logic holds because the spoken description gives the rustic/continental characterization, and the cited shape commonality across Asian regions exemplifies the broader connection. Note: the proposed answer says \"bowl shape,\" while Slice 67 only specifies a common shape (not necessarily a bowl), but the core support remains intact.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the man holds a blue-and-white patterned bowl and the subtitle states, 'The pottery is rustic but dignified and refined. It has a continental feel to it.' In Clip 2, the same man holds an unglazed bowl and the subtitle says, 'This is a common shape in Asia from southern China to Vietnam.' These spoken explanations directly support the claim about the pottery's rustic nature and its connection to broader Asian cultures."

Step 2: Slice 26 shows an exhibit with labeled pottery origins (Vietnam/China/Ryukyu), emphasizing exchange. Step 3: Slice 60 shows an artisan shaping clay inspired by centuries-old Ryukyu Wakuta ware. Step 4: Slice 61 shows a potter forming a tall clay piece on a wheel. Conclusion: The film bridges ancient trade-linked heritage to present-day making practices.",

Step 3: Slice 60 presents a modern artisan explicitly drawing inspiration from centuries-old Ryukyu Wakuta ware, and Slice 61 further shows a contemporary potter shaping clay. Logic holds because the documentary sequence moves from historical trade-influenced artifacts to diverse regional exhibits and then to modern artisans working with heritage inspiration.",

Step 4: Slice 85 shows museum pottery including a fish-motif vase. Conclusion: Fish imagery is tracked from technique-heavy workshop creation to repeated museum motifs.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 12 explicitly states the artisan explains his fish plate is made from Okinawan clay and that carving reveals the red underneath, with shots showing white and then blue glaze layers. Step 2: Slice 11 supports the artisan’s fish-themed work, showing him carving and painting plates with fish designs and discussing his inspiration. Step 3: Slice 36 shows a museum/exhibit ceramic jar featuring a hand-painted fish motif, indicating the fish imagery appears in cultural artifacts beyond the artisan’s studio. Step 4: Slice 85 further shows museum pieces, including a vase with a fish motif among traditional Japanese pottery. Logic holds because the artisan’s specific technique (carving to reveal red clay under varying glazes) is linked to fish imagery, and later museum scenes show fish motifs across artifacts, supporting the idea of fish as a recurring cultural design element.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 2, the artisan explicitly states that carving reveals the red Okinawan clay underneath and that the result is a bold, rustic design. The finished plate with a colored fish is shown. In Clip 3, a museum piece with a carved fish motif is displayed, and the subtitle notes that such designs 'embraced elements from foreign cultures' and 'Made them feel Okinawan,' directly linking the technique to cultural identity and continuity. This visual and verbal evidence supports the answer's claim about the multi-step process and the enduring cultural motif."

Step 3: Slice 84 later shows a guardian lion statue at the Tamaudun mausoleum, a sacred/memorial site, demonstrating guardian imagery in such spaces. Step 4: Slice 82 further situates the later visit within an ancient, ceremonial setting, supporting the context of sacred/memorial spaces. Logic holds because the video first introduces and shows Shisa being made with their guardian meaning, then presents guardian lion figures at a mausoleum, tying the craft to its cultural function in spiritual places.",
