Step 2: Slice 69 explicitly states the man is holding an open book titled 'The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World,' with focus on the title page. Logic holds because these are two distinct atlases shown as physical books at different points, matching the proposed titles.",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 88 shows a documentary-style wooden sign explicitly introducing \"Badwater Basin\" as 282 feet below sea level. Step 2: Slice 88 then transitions to a map labeled \"Death Valley,\" providing broader geographic context for the area containing Badwater Basin. Step 3: Slice 89 shows an atlas map of Death Valley National Park examined at a desk, with a man pointing to locations, indicating a closer examination of the region. Logic holds because the land location introduced by the sign (Badwater Basin within Death Valley) is then examined via an atlas map of Death Valley at the desk, supporting the combined answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with a documentary-style sign that explicitly reads 'BADWATER BASIN 282 FEET / 86 METERS BELOW SEA LEVEL'. The video then transitions to a satellite view labeled 'Badwater Basin' and an arrow pointing to its depth. Clip 2 immediately follows this by showing a person at a desk flipping through an atlas, zooming in on a map of the USA Southwest, and pointing directly at 'Death Valley National Park', which contains Badwater Basin. This sequence visually confirms that Badwater Basin/Death Valley is the location introduced by the sign and then examined in the atlas."

Step 2: Later, a close-up explicitly highlights the Hudson Canyon off the coast of New York. Conclusion: The revisited feature is the Hudson Canyon in that same region.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 23 describes a detailed bathymetry map of the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, explicitly naming underwater canyons such as Hudson Canyon and Baltimore Canyon. Step 2: Slice 32 shows a close-up focusing specifically on the Hudson Canyon off the coast of New York. Logic holds because the initial region is the northeastern U.S. Atlantic coast with named canyons, and it is later revisited with a focused close-up on Hudson Canyon off New York.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (0:03-0:06) shows a detailed bathymetric map of the northeastern U.S. Atlantic coast, clearly labeling 'Hudson Canyon' near New York/New Jersey. Clip 2 (0:10-0:14) revisits this exact same area with a focused close-up on the 'Hudson Canyon' label and its depth (-4218), confirming it is the specific canyon off New York being highlighted."

Step 2: Slice 21 shows the man holding an atlas and pointing to different locations on the map, explicitly including Australia and New Zealand. Logic holds because the next described action after the globe scene involves pointing in the atlas, and the two explicitly named locations he points to are Australia and New Zealand.",

Step 2: Slice 78 shows the same page's details, including the origin listed as a town in California, USA, establishing the Earth-based name origin. Logic holds because the two slices describe the same entry and collectively provide both the planetary body and origin information.",
        "visual_proof": "The database entry shown in both clips clearly lists 'Target: Mars' and 'Feature Name: Badwater'. The 'Origin' field explicitly states 'Town in California, USA.', directly confirming the planetary body and the Earth location cited as the origin for the feature name."
