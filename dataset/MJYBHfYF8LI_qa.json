        "question": "Which expert who argues that tightening policy in Japan is likely a mistake later appears while the show discusses Sino-Ocean’s expected FY2023 loss?",

        ],
        "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 8 identifies Kyle Rodda and quotes his view that tightening policy in Japan is likely a mistake. Step 2: Slice 13 shows the panel discussing Sino-Ocean’s expected loss while Kyle Rodda is again present. Conclusion: it is Kyle Rodda.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 8 explicitly states that Kyle Rodda, identified as a Senior Market Analyst, is discussing Japan’s monetary policy with the overlay 'RODDA: TIGHTENING POLICY IN JAPAN IS QUITE LIKELY A MISTAKE,' establishing him as the expert making that argument. Step 2: Slice 13 shows a panel including Kyle Rodda, and the lower third indicates a discussion shifting to Sino-Ocean Group’s expected FY2023 loss. Logic holds because the same named expert (Kyle Rodda) is present during the later segment discussing Sino-Ocean’s expected FY2023 loss.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the on-screen text identifies Kyle Rodda and states his opinion: 'RODDA: TIGHTENING POLICY IN JAPAN IS QUITE LIKELY A MISTAKE'. In Clip 2, the same individual, Kyle Rodda, is shown in a three-way split screen discussing Sino-Ocean's FY loss, with the chyron reading 'SINO-OCEAN SEES FY LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE...'. The visual continuity of the person and the context provided by the chyrons confirm that Kyle Rodda is the expert who appears in both segments."

        "question": "In the Evergrande coverage, the show first focuses on a specific place named after the company and later shows on-the-ground imagery of unfinished projects. What is the named place, and what kind of imagery follows later?",

        "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 17 highlights the sign for 'Evergrande Plaza.' Step 2: Slice 31 shows an unfinished construction site while the Evergrande scandal headline runs. Conclusion: Evergrande Plaza is followed by unfinished construction imagery.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 17 shows a sign for 'Evergrande Plaza,' clearly identifying a place named after the company. Step 2: Slice 31 depicts a static shot of an urban construction site with a partially constructed, unfinished building. Logic holds because the first focus is on 'Evergrande Plaza,' and later imagery shows unfinished construction sites, matching the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a sign with the text '恒大国际广场' and 'EVERGRANDE PLAZA', identifying the named place. Clip 2 shows exposed concrete frames and rebar of an unfinished building under construction, confirming the on-the-ground imagery of incomplete projects."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 39 identifies Annabelle Droulers as one of the participants in a panel discussing Evergrande, with her name shown and described as wearing a pink top. Step 2: Evidence Slice 65 shows Annabelle Droulers as a news anchor, wearing a red top, presenting a segment titled 'HK SECURITY LAW NEARS VOTE.' Logic holds because the same named individual (Annabelle Droulers) is first part of the Evergrande discussion and later appears as the anchor in a red top for the Hong Kong security-law segment.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, Annabelle Droulers is visibly present in the three-person panel discussing Evergrande, wearing a red top. In Clip 2, the same individual, identified by on-screen text as 'ANNABELLE DROULERS', is shown alone presenting a segment titled 'HK SECURITY LAW NEARS VOTE', also wearing the same red top. This confirms she participated in the earlier panel and later presented the Hong Kong security-law segment."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 61 describes a news segment showing smoke from a Russian refinery incident, indicating it's part of a larger broadcast. Step 2: Slice 63 presents a subsequent news segment featuring President Biden and PM Netanyahu, with the text overlay 'BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU OVER RAFAH.' Step 3: The question asks which U.S. political headline appears after the refinery segment; the only U.S.-focused headline provided is 'BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU OVER RAFAH,' so the proposed answer aligns with the context.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 ends with a headline about Ukrainian drones shutting down Russian refining. Clip 2 immediately follows with a split-screen of Biden and Netanyahu, overlaid with the headline 'BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU OVER RAFAH,' confirming this is the next U.S. political headline shown."
