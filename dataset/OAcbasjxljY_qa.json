    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 1 describes the host in front of a wall covered with travel photos and a world map, wearing a white T-shirt with a large 'G' logo. This matches the 'postcard wall/geography segment' setting. Step 2: Evidence Slice 43 shows the host in a studio-like setting with a black background and a Slovakian flag, wearing a green T-shirt while teaching Slovak/Czech vocabulary. Logic holds because the two slices clearly depict different settings and explicitly note the clothing colors, supporting the transition from white T-shirt to green T-shirt.",

Step 2: Slice 37 shows the same presenter in a similar postcard-wall setting picking up a small wooden object described as a miniature replica of a traditional musical instrument, with on-screen text confirming it as a small wooden souvenir replica. Logic holds because both slices depict the same setting and presenter, with different props aligning with the proposed answer.",

In the second clip, he is clearly holding a dark brown, carved wooden object that looks like a miniature axe or tool, with text on it, and a subtitle confirms it's 'a small wooden souvenir replica'."

In Clip 2, the presenter is holding a small object that visually matches the green frog shown in the inset image next to the Slovakian flag. The presenter's gestures and focus on the object confirm he is holding it."

Step 3: Slice 29 shows labeled wildlife segments (text labels 'European Bear', 'Wild Foxes', 'Mink'), supporting the later display of wildlife species. The minor Slovenia/Slovakia mention in Slice 29 pertains to a map but does not contradict the claim that wildlife species are shown afterward; VLM naming noise is acceptable per instructions. Therefore, the proposed sequence is supported by the slices.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 ends with an animated title card reading 'PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY'. Clip 2 shows a presenter in a studio with a screen displaying the Slovak flag and images of Slovakian mountains and streams.

Step 3: Slice 45 presents a screen with the Slovakia flag and text comparing Slovak and Czech words for 'turtle,' clearly a Slovak/Czech vocabulary translation segment. Step 4: Slice 38 displays 'SLOVAKIA DEMOGRAPHICS' with an animated pie chart breaking down the population, matching a demographics breakdown. The sequence logically connects flags → vocabulary → demographics as described.",

Clip 2 continues this by comparing the flags of Slovenia and Slovakia, introducing the 'Sloven...' root.

Step 3: Slice 75 details later frames using maps and text overlays to depict Slavic migrations and historical states (Great Moravia, Austro-Hungarians, Czechoslovakia). Logic holds because the video begins with a breaking-news style in the postcard/map room and then switches to historical visuals (illustrations and maps), matching the proposed linkage.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a woman delivering a 'BREAKING NEWS' segment in front of a wall covered with maps and postcards. Clip 2 transitions to the male host in the same room, who then introduces historical content, including a map of Celtic tribes and an illustration of an invasion.

Step 2: Slice 71 shows a long-haired presenter speaking with a text overlay titled 'Notable artists' listing various artists, which supports the claim that later a presenter appears with an on-screen list of notable artists. Logic holds because the two slices depict sequentially different segments: first a collage of notable figures, then a presenter with a 'Notable artists' overlay.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually displays a collage with names like 'Earl \"Svätopluk\"', 'L'udovít Štúr', and 'Marek Hamšík', identifying them as notable Slovak figures. Clip 2 then shows a man with long curly hair presenting, with a text overlay in the top-left corner explicitly titled 'Notable artists:' followed by a different list of names like 'Polemic', 'Horkýže Slíže', and 'Katarína Knechtová'.

Step 3: Slice 75 presents historical timeline maps (including Czechoslovakia 1918), maintaining the map-based Slovakia-related visuals through historical context. Step 4: Slice 80 describes an animation symbolizing the division of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, confirming the culminating split animation. Logic holds because the proposed answer identifies the recurring flag and map highlights and the final split animation, all directly supported by the slices.",
