Step 3: The setting and clothing are consistent across slices (dark blue sweatshirt, room with plants and bookshelf), so minor differences in hair description can be treated as VLM noise. The logic holds that both refer to the same video and person.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:07, the word 'lonely' appears in large white text on screen as the woman reacts emotionally. In Clip 2, at 0:00, a text overlay reads '(i am an ENFP, 70% extroverted and 30% introverted)'."
