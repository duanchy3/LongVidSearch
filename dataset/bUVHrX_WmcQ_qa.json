Step 2: Evidence Slice 20 explicitly shows the word 'Schistosomiasis' with an image of a worm, indicating the disease introduced. Logic holds because the first part confirms the country (Rwanda) associated with 'Powerhouse,' and the later segment introduces the disease (schistosomiasis).",

This matches the 'explorer-in-hat segment.' Step 2: Slice 34 shows a map highlighting Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park with an image of gorillas and text naming the park, matching the 'Bwindi gorilla map segment.' Logic holds because each segment distinctly features the specified elements.",

The slice explicitly notes she is sharing opinions on luxury brands, specifically Rolex.

Step 2: Evidence Slice 57 shows the text \"Top 5 Refugee host nations on earth\" followed by the Uganda flag and \"Largest in Africa (11 settlement camps),\" associating those labels with Uganda.

In Clip 2, the same Ugandan flag is shown next to the text 'Top 5 Refugee host nations on earth' and later 'Largest in Africa (11 settlement camps)'. The consistent visual pairing of the Ugandan flag with both sets of text across the clips confirms that Uganda is the country associated with these labels."

Step 2: Slice 46 describes an animated transition where 'DEMOGRAPHICS' appears with a large red upward arrow and a crowd background, matching 'the crowd graphic with the big upward arrow.' The context clearly supports both parts of the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:10, an animated title card explicitly reads 'POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY' over a stylized map. This is immediately followed by a scene (0:12-0:16) where the three hosts stand in front of a detailed political map of Uganda. In Clip 2, at 0:10, a new animated title card appears with the word 'DEMOGRAPHICS' overlaid on a graphic showing a crowd and a large red upward-pointing arrow, clearly marking a thematic shift."
