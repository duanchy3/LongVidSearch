        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 18 shows a person holding a box labeled 'Canon PIXMA TR8520' with the text 'big boi machines,' indicating a Canon printer as the new equipment. Step 2: Slice 39 shows a Canon-branded printer actively printing a colorful 'Happy Birthday' design. Logic holds because the equipment first appears boxed (Canon printer) and later is shown in use printing the artwork, with the brand 'Canon' explicitly visible in both contexts.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a person is holding a boxed Canon PIXMA iX6820 printer with the text 'big boi machines' overlaid. In Clip 2, a Canon printer is actively printing a colorful image (though it says 'I DIDN'T ASK', not 'Happy Birthday'). The brand and product type are visually confirmed across both clips."

        "question": "Which tool is introduced while still in its packaging and later used in a “hand cutting” demonstration to cut paper?",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 24 states the woman is holding a Swingline paper trimmer in its packaging, opens it, and places the trimmer in front of her—clearly introducing the tool. Step 2: Slice 53 shows a person using a paper cutter to cut pink paper, with 'hand cutting' on screen—a demonstration of using such a tool. Logic holds because both slices refer to the same type of tool (paper trimmer/cutter), with Slice 24 identifying it as a Swingline paper trimmer and Slice 53 showing its use in a hand cutting demo. Differences in person description are acceptable VLM noise.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the person holds up a green box labeled 'Swingline ClassicCut Lite' with text overlay 'SWINGLINE paper trimmer', showing it in its packaging. In Clip 2, the same person is seen using the unboxed grey and green tool to cut purple paper, with a text overlay reading 'hand cutting'."

Conclusion: The platform discussed alongside online selling workflow is Etsy.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 69 explicitly shows the Etsy logo and includes the phrases 'easy to use and advertise on' and 'etsy fees can be hefty' linked to the platform, clearly identifying Etsy as the subject. Step 2: Slice 70 depicts a computer-based workflow involving configuring options, product listings, and search results, aligning with an online product/listing demonstration later in the video. Step 3: The combination directly supports that the platform described is Etsy.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 explicitly shows the 'etsy' logo and text stating 'easy to use and advertise on' and 'etsy fees can be hefty'. Clip 2 visually demonstrates a workflow within the Etsy Shop Manager interface, including adding product variations, setting inventory, pricing, shipping options, and publishing listings, confirming the platform is Etsy."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 17 explicitly lists 'brown A7 envelopes - 100 ct, $14' among purchased supplies with cost text. Step 2: Slice 72 shows brown envelopes being labeled and prepared for packaging. Logic holds because the material named in Slice 17 matches the brown envelopes shown in Slice 72 being used in the process.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (0:36-0:39), a package of brown envelopes is shown with the on-screen text 'brown A7 envelopes - 100 ct, $14'. In Clip 2 (0:00-0:03), the same brown envelopes are visually depicted being prepared for packaging, as a person applies blue labels to them. This confirms the material listed in Clip 1 is the same one being used in Clip 2."

Step 2: Slice 10 says the video highlights 'Procreate for iPad' and showcases the app's capabilities, confirming a drawing app for the same kind of device (iPad). Logic holds because both slices reference an iPad, and Procreate is specifically for iPad, matching the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 explicitly shows the 'Procreate for iPad' app logo and lists its features. Clip 2 visually confirms the device is an 'iPad Pro 1st Gen' as labeled on screen, and the user is drawing a ramen bowl using this device, which aligns with the context of digital drawing instruction."
