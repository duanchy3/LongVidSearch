        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 30 describes a segment about a Roomba vacuum learning to avoid poop. Step 2: Slice 4 describes a segment featuring 'Weights & Biases' with the subtitle 'Developer Tools for Machine Learning,' showing Python code and various graphs/charts, which matches the description of a developer tool with code and experiment graphs. Logic holds because the question asks which earlier segment fits that description before the Roomba segment, and Slice 4 clearly matches it.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 explicitly shows the 'Weights & Biases' logo and the text 'DEVELOPER TOOLS FOR MACHINE LEARNING'. It displays a user interface with code (Python scripts using wandb.init) on the left and experiment tracking graphs (e.g., 'Runs', 'Charts' for 'Glass Bottle', 'Plastic Bottle') on the right, which directly corresponds to the description in the question.

This supports the topic being about speech synthesis from audio-derived units; calling it \"speech synthesis from raw audio\" aligns with the description, and the use of pseudo-phone units and self-supervised models is consistent with textless approaches. Step 2: Slice 11 explicitly states there is a slide showing a graph from Facebook AI comparing codecs based on MUSHRA scores and bit rates, listing specific codecs. This directly supports the follow-up slide being a codec comparison plot using MUSHRA vs bit rate. Logic holds because the first slide explains the model architecture for speech synthesis and the next slide compares codec performance metrics.",
