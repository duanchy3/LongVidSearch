Step 3: The question asks what outdoor scene later shows her walking during sunset; the described bridge-walking scene matches this. Slice 40 is an outdoor rooftop sitting scene and is not about walking, but does not contradict. The logic holds because Slice 12 directly supports the claim of walking across a bridge at sunset after the class.",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 29 shows a tablet displaying the book 'Race After Technology' in a café context, and Slice 31 further situates the tablet reading in an outdoor café setting, supporting that she first reads the book at a café. Step 2: Slice 30 explicitly states via subtitle 'time to read and annotate for race & ethnic relations!' while the person is at an outdoor table, confirming the annotation activity and location. Step 3: Slice 33 shows a Zoom meeting interface for a class on race and ethnic relations with the woman in a home office, indicating she later attends the related Zoom class from home.
