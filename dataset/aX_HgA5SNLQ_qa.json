Step 2: Slice 65 outlines the video structure: a split-screen segment followed by a solo segment featuring a woman with short hair and glasses wearing a blue top against a plain white background, then a title card. Step 3: The visual attributes (glasses, blue top, plain white background, solo speaking) match between the woman in Slice 2 and the solo segment after the split-screen in Slice 65. Logic holds because the same visually described person appears first in a white-background solo setting and returns in the closing solo segment after the split-screen.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the woman in the blue top and glasses is shown speaking against a plain white background from 0:01 to 0:58. In Video 2, after the split-screen segment ends at 0:03, she reappears at 0:04 against the same white background, continuing her speech until 0:23 before the video fades to the 'THE MET' logo.

Step 2: Slice 27 similarly shows a man in a green leather jacket over a black turtleneck in an indoor setting with a radiator and a glass-paneled door, speaking and gesturing toward the camera.

Step 2: Slice 51 describes a dimly lit gallery where two mannequins on a central platform are highlighted by dramatic lighting; it is a static display with no action, implying no people and mannequins as the display method. Logic holds because both locations use mannequins as the primary means to showcase fashion without people present.",

Clip 2 shows a dark, narrow space with three mannequins under spotlights, highlighting the clothing without any people present. Both scenes use mannequins as the exclusive display method."

Step 3: Slice 62 shows a split-screen; on the right side, a man with glasses and a dark sweater over a collared shirt is seated in front of a densely packed bookshelf, while the left side features a woman on a couch with circles artwork.
