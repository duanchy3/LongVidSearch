Step 2: Slice 72 shows quirky British competitions such as the Cooper Hill Cheese Rolling Race, tug of war, and shin kicking. Step 3: Slice 73 adds more quirky traditions including pancake racing, stinging nettle eating, and gravy wrestling. Logic holds because the earlier violent phenomenon is football hooliganism (Slice 69), and at least one later quirky competition (e.g., cheese rolling or pancake racing) is clearly shown (Slices 72, 73).",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 explicitly shows scenes of football hooliganism with crowds, smoke, and police intervention. Clip 2 and Clip 3 show a sequence of quirky traditional competitions: Cooper Hill cheese rolling race, tar barrel racing, toe wrestling, shin kicking, pancake racing, stinging nettle eating contest, and gravy wrestling. The temporal order of the clips confirms that the violent phenomenon (hooliganism) is presented before the quirky competitions."
