    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 4 explicitly states the man stands in front of a building with a sign that reads \"GIGO,\" which supports the answer's identification of the sign. Step 2: Slice 43 shows the interior of a major electronics store (Onoden) with displays of refrigerators and washing machines, matching the answer's description of large home appliances shown later. The answer does not make unsupported claims about a brand president; it only states what is shown, which is supported by the context.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:07-0:10, the man gestures towards a building with a prominent red sign that reads \"GiGO\". In Clip 2, from 0:06 to 0:13, the interior of a large electronics store is shown, displaying rows of refrigerators and washing machines. The exterior shot in Clip 2 at 0:00 also features the same \"GiGO\" building, confirming it is the same location."

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 52 explicitly states, 'The turning point was when PCs came on the scene,' during a discussion in an electronics store. Step 2: Slice 40 describes a woman explaining her DIY project of making her own speakers using different parts to achieve different sounds. Logic holds because the first slice identifies the major technology (PCs) as the turning point, and the second slice details the woman's DIY speaker-making.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, an older man states, 'The turning point was when PCs came on the scene.' In Clip 2, a woman says, 'I make my own speakers. Using different parts gives you a different sound,' directly confirming both parts of the answer."

    "question": "What change in the meaning of ‘otaku’ is discussed, and what later statement of collective support in Akihabara echoes that social acceptance theme?",
    "answer": "It’s said ‘otaku’ has become a positive term (whereas it used to be hidden), and later a maid states “We’re all on the same team… If someone’s in a fix, we’ll get through it together.”",

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 81 explicitly states via subtitles that 'Today \"otaku\" has become a positive term... But in the past, I hid my interests,' which describes the shift from negative/hidden to positive. Step 2: Slice 95 quotes the maid saying, 'We're all on the same team. Team Akihabara, united,' and 'If someone's in a fix, we'll get through it together,' indicating collective support. Logic holds because the proposed answer reflects both the stated shift in 'otaku' meaning and the later communal support quote from Akihabara.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the subtitle explicitly states 'Today \"otaku\" has become a positive term' and 'But in the past, I hid my interests,' indicating a shift from stigma to acceptance. In Clip 2, the same maid character says, 'We're all on the same team. Team Akihabara, united. If someone's in a fix, we'll get through it together,' which visually reinforces the theme of community and mutual support among otaku, echoing the social acceptance mentioned earlier."

Step 2: Slice 92 shows a group photo of women in maid outfits with the text 'Sotokanda Maid Association' at the bottom, explicitly identifying an organized association context. Logic holds because the first slice provides the seasonal decoration and the second slice names the broader association.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, an orange balloon with a black jack-o'-lantern face is visible on the right side of the counter, alongside a partially visible 'HAPPY HALLOWEEN' banner.

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 8 describes retro game cartridges and explicitly mentions a sign displaying '10% UP' near them. Step 2: Slice 49 describes an audio equipment store segment where a specific turntable is highlighted with a price tag of 37,400 yen. Logic holds because the question asks for the promotional text near the cartridges and the later price-tagged audio product, both of which are directly stated in the respective slices.",
    "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:06-0:08), a red sign above the game cartridges clearly reads '10% UP'. In Video 2 (0:09-0:10), a shelf of turntables includes one with a prominent yellow price tag showing '¥37,400'."

Step 2: Slice 9 states the video starts with a close-up of a Nintendo Super Famicom console in its original packaging. Logic holds because the first item examined is clearly a cartridge in the retro game store, and the subsequent scene shows a Nintendo Super Famicom console in original packaging in another store.",
    "visual_proof": "In the first clip, the man is seen picking up and inspecting a beige game cartridge from a rack of similar items. In the second clip, a Nintendo Super Famicom console, still sealed in its original plastic wrapping, is clearly visible on a metal shelf."

Step 2: Slice 67 discusses businesses from different historical stages still thriving. Step 3: Slice 63 shows a dedicated amateur radio shop with specialized equipment. Conclusion: The decades-old store plus thriving-stage commentary is reinforced by continued niche specialty retail like ham radio shops.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 64 explicitly states, via on-screen text, that the store the two men are in front of \"has been in business for decades\" and has \"withstood the test of time,\" which serves as the earlier example of a long-standing shop. Step 2: Slice 63 shows a specialized amateur radio shop with shelves of radios and communication equipment, demonstrating a niche store thriving. Step 3: Slice 67 discusses enduring businesses across historical stages, aligning with the narrative about longevity. Thus, the proposed answer—citing a decades-old store praised as withstanding the test of time and a specialized amateur radio shop—matches the evidence and supports the idea of niche stores persisting.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows the older man gesturing at a storefront while the subtitle says, 'This place has been in business for decades. It's withstood the test of time.' Clip 3 then visually confirms the specialization by showing shelves packed with amateur radios and the subtitle explicitly calling it 'a destination for amateur radio enthusiasts,' directly supporting the claim about niche stores."

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 43 shows an exterior shot of Onoden and then immediately transitions indoors to displays of refrigerators and then washing machines, indicating the retail product category shown is major home appliances. Step 2: Slice 44 quotes the President of Onoden explaining that electronics wholesalers set up shop in the early 1940s, then began retailing, which led to more retailers opening in Akihabara. Logic holds because the first part answers the visual category shown after the exterior sign, and the second part directly cites the later explanation linking early retail growth to wholesalers becoming retailers.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually shows rows of refrigerators and washing machines inside Onoden. Clip 2 features Ono Kazushi, President of Onoden, stating via subtitle: 'A few electronics wholesalers set up shop in the early 1940s. Then they started to do retail. That led to more retailers opening up in Akihabara.' This directly links the product category shown and the historical explanation."

Step 3: Slice 47 further shows the blue-jacketed man holding and explaining boomboxes in the same store, emphasizing audio nostalgia. Logic holds because the same visually described person (blue jacket) moves from retro electronics browsing to highlighting cassette players/boomboxes in a retail display, matching the proposed answer.",
