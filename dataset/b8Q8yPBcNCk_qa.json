Step 2: Slice 54 shows a tank in a city using debris as protection with the on-screen label 'OBSTACLE HULLDOWN,' identifying the specific technique. Logic holds because the initial defensive theme is introduced and later a defensive technique is explicitly labeled in the urban tank scene.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with a title card displaying the word 'DEFENSIVE'. Clip 2 shows a tank positioned behind rubble in an urban setting, with a title card explicitly labeling this tactic as 'OBSTACLE HULLDOWN'. The sequence confirms that the general concept of 'Defensive' is introduced first, and then a specific defensive technique, 'Obstacle Hull Down', is shown later."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 49 explicitly mentions the on-screen text 'BACKSLOPE HULLDOWN,' which denotes using the reverse side of a slope for positioning. Logic holds because both labels appear in the provided context and match the described tactics in the question.",

The proposed answer lists these three labels, matching the captions despite minor formatting differences.",
        "visual_proof": "The answer is visually confirmed by the on-screen text labels in each clip. Clip 1 (0:17) displays the text 'HULL-DOWN POSITION TANK TACTIC'. Clip 2 (0:00) shows the text 'DOWNSLOPE HULLDOWN'. Clip 3 (0:00) clearly shows the text 'OBSTACLE HULLDOWN'.

Conclusion: The focus stays on tanks/armored units while the environment changes.",

Step 2: Slice 46 depicts a desert scene with three tanks lined up, focusing on their positioning and military context. Step 3: Slice 48 also shows three tanks moving in a desert, maintaining tanks as the central subject. Logic holds because across these slices, the environment shifts (lush to desert), while tanks remain the consistent focus, indicating continuity of armored units across environments.",

Conclusion: The video moves from frontline movement to trench defense to strategic WWI mapping.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 23 describes soldiers in beige uniforms marching across a barren landscape, matching 'open-ground marching.' Slice 20 similarly shows marching soldiers in a desolate terrain. Step 2: Slice 23’s second scene shows trench defenders with a line of burning stakes (fire barrier), and Slice 25 reinforces trench defense with sandbags, barbed wire, and a visible line of fire. Step 3: Slice 29 features a military map labeled 'SECRET' specifically referencing the Passchendaele region in WWI, aligning with 'strategic mapping of Passchendaele marked SECRET.' The sequence and elements are explicitly supported.",
