        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 7 describes airport footage prominently featuring a Singapore Airlines Boeing 787 with clear branding. Step 2: Evidence Slice 12 shows an interview about maritime decarbonisation overlooking a port, indicating the pivot in the program’s narrative. Logic holds because the question asks which airline is shown before the pivot to the maritime interview; Slice 7 explicitly identifies Singapore Airlines, and Slice 12 confirms the subsequent maritime segment.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 clearly shows a large white passenger aircraft on the tarmac with 'SINGAPORE AIRLINES' written in large, dark blue letters along its fuselage. The airline's logo is also visible near the cockpit. This footage establishes the airline as the subject before Clip 2 transitions to an interview about maritime decarbonisation."
