Step 2: Slice 3 describes earlier in the video a large white canvas on the table while the man explains, and also mentions another blank canvas on an easel, implying the canvas on the table was blank/white earlier. Logic holds because the surface being white during painting and shown as white beforehand supports the implication it was blank/white earlier.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the artist is standing behind a large, uniformly white canvas, gesturing as if explaining something. In Video 2, the same artist is actively painting broad black strokes onto that same canvas, which is still predominantly white except for the newly applied paint. The visual continuity between the two clips confirms the surface was white before and during the painting process."

Step 2: Slice 20 shows the man then sanding a dark-colored large flat surface with a sanding block, indicating the next major surface-treatment step. Logic holds because the first action is cleaning/wiping, and the later step is sanding, matching the question’s sequence.",

In Clip 1 (0:01-0:03) and Clip 2 (0:05-0:12), he uses circular and back-and-forth motions to clean or prep the surface. The act of sanding is not visually depicted in either clip; however, the question asks what action *prepares* the surface *before* sanding and what the *next major step* is. The consistent wiping action across both clips serves as the preparatory step. While sanding itself isn't shown, the context implies that cleaning precedes sanding as the next major treatment step, which aligns with standard workshop practices and the sequence presented."

Step 2: Slice 30 describes a later, more detailed stage: the man paints on a black canvas, carefully applying white paint with precise brushstrokes. Step 3: Therefore, the canvas color changes from white (early) to black (later), and the paint color used changes from black (early) to white (later). Slice 14, showing a black canvas with black paint, does not contradict this and can be an intermediate phase.",

The actions listed in the proposed answer (smooth, clean/wipe, sand) are each directly supported by the slices.
