        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 2 explicitly includes the text overlay 'Thanks to YouGov for sponsoring this video!', confirming the sponsor is YouGov. Step 2: Evidence Slice 62 describes a three-person livestream layout and notes a logo with the text 'FlatEarthDave.com' and a QR code, indicating the promoted website is FlatEarthDave.com. Logic holds because the slices directly state both elements asked in the question.",

In Clip 2 (0:01-0:08), the bottom panel of the three-person livestream layout features a red banner with the website 'FlatEarthDave.com' prominently displayed."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 12 states the studio host is a man wearing a white hat who appears multiple times in a studio setting. Step 2: Slice 20 also begins with a man wearing a white hat and then transitions to a TV interview explicitly identifying 'Felix Baumgartner' as a 'Daredevil Skydiver' via on-screen text. Logic holds because the headwear is clearly white (hat/cap) and the skydiver is named Felix Baumgartner in the news segment.",
        "visual_proof": "In multiple frames of Clip 1 (e.g., 0:00, 0:06) and Clip 2 (e.g., 0:01, 0:08), the studio host is clearly visible wearing a white baseball cap. In Clip 2, the news segment at 0:13-0:17 displays a lower-third graphic that explicitly identifies the skydiver as 'FELIX BAUMGARTNER' with the title 'Daredevil Skydiver'."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 62 describes a split-screen livestream with three participants and notes a logo reading 'FlatEarthDave.com' on the screen. Logic holds because the question asks for the space-travel headline from the news segment and the flat-earth website shown later; both are explicitly identified in their respective slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the news ticker at the bottom clearly reads 'SIR RICHARD BRANSON TRAVELS TO THE EDGE OF SPACE'. In Video 2, the lower panel displays the text 'FlatEarthDave.com' directly under the speaker's video feed."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 90 describes a later animated branding card featuring a circular emblem with a globe and the text 'Sci Man Dan'. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention the same animated channel name appearing in both places.",
        "visual_proof": "The animated branding card appears at the end of Clip 1 (0:18-0:21) and is the sole content of Clip 2 (0:00-0:13). In both instances, the text 'Sci Man Dan' is clearly displayed in white letters next to a cartoon avatar and a globe icon. The same branding is shown in both clips, confirming it as the recurring channel name."
