        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 54 describes fish that are fresh, gutted, stuffed with vegetables, and arranged on a foil-lined baking tray, indicating they are raw and prepared for cooking. Step 2: Slice 62 shows the fish being unwrapped from foil in a dish, appearing cooked with a golden-brown color, and explicitly notes they have been baked or grilled. Logic holds because the fish transition from raw/prepared to cooked/golden-brown for serving. The mention of baking in the answer aligns with the caption's baked-or-grilled indication, and the core change (raw to cooked) is explicitly supported.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the fish are visibly raw with translucent flesh and bright, uncooked vegetables inside. In Clip 2, after being uncovered from foil, the fish flesh is opaque and white, the skin has a golden-brown hue, and the stuffing appears softened and cooked, indicating they have been baked."

Step 2: Slice 59 describes a white dog with black patches around its eyes and ears lying on its side, then transitioning to a man near a stone structure with a glass door (consistent with a rustic outdoor setup). Logic holds because both slices present an animal resting and then cut to a rustic outdoor cooking-related setting. The two animals are described differently: one is a black-and-white puppy; the other is a mostly white dog with black patches around the eyes (and ears).",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:00-0:02), a puppy with distinct black-and-white markings is seen lying down. In Video 2 (0:00-0:03), a different, larger dog that is mostly white with black patches around its eyes and ears is shown sleeping in the grass. The visual evidence confirms two different animals with the described appearances."
