Step 2: It then says the camera pans across the room to students at computers. Logic holds because the question asks what machine is shown operating before the pan, which matches the description in Slice 24.",

In Clip 1 (0:02-0:08) and Clip 2 (0:03-0:05), a large roll of white paper is visibly being fed through this machine, which has the characteristic design of a wide-format printer or plotter. The machine is situated in what is clearly a computer lab with students at workstations in the background."
