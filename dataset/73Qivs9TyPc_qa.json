Conclusion: The shared ingredient added to egg mixtures in both parts is heavy cream.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 2 states that the person is whisking a mixture in a green bowl and explicitly mentions that heavy cream is poured into the bowl while whisking. This supports that heavy cream is the ingredient added to the mixture at that stage. Step 2: Slice 84 shows a close-up of heavy cream (labeled 'Heavy Cream - 1 cup' / 'Sahne - 200 ml') being poured into a creamy mixture in the same type of green bowl, consistent with a similar addition later. Logic holds because both slices explicitly show heavy cream being added to a whisked mixture, matching the question’s description of the ingredient added after eggs are cracked and later poured into another egg mixture for a baked dish.",

Step 3: Slice 75 shows the bowl being mixed, featuring broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms—confirming the colorful mixture includes these.
