Step 2: Evidence Slice 33 shows an Etherscan page focused on the SingularityNET (AGI) token with price and market statistics. Logic holds because both slices reference the same token (AGI) being used in the architecture and later shown with market data on a blockchain explorer.",
        "visual_proof": "In the first clip, the architecture diagram explicitly labels 'AGI Token' as the currency used for transactions between various AI nodes.

Conclusion: Figure 2 is an agent-level workflow; Figure 5 is platform-level infrastructure.",

Cognitive Synergy between AI Agents' with components like Text Summarizer, Word Sense Disambiguation, Entity Extraction, and Video Summarizer, plus arrows indicating inputs/outputs (e.g., Disambiguated Words, Labeled Entities). This supports that the figure represents interactions among AI agents. Step 2: Evidence Slices 14 and 30 describe 'Figure 5. The key components of our platform' with Service Consumers, Service Providers, Discovery Service, Registry, Multi-Party Protocol/Executor, Regions, APIs, and Payment Gateway, clearly depicting a platform-level architecture for service discovery, registration, execution, and payments across regions. Step 3: The scope difference indicates they represent different layers: agent-level cognitive interactions vs platform-level system architecture. The proposed answer aligns with these descriptions, including discovery and payment elements and regions.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows 'Figure 2. Cognitive synergy between AI Agents,' depicting specific AI nodes (Text Summarizer, Entity Extraction) and their data flow (Disambiguated Words, Labeled Entities). Clip 2 and 3 show 'Figure 5. The key components of our platform,' which is a much larger architectural diagram including Service Consumers, Service Providers, Regions, a Registry, Multi-Party Escrow, and On/Off Chain components. The visual scope and labeled elements clearly differentiate the first as a micro-level agent interaction model and the second as a macro-level platform infrastructure."

Step 3: Evidence Slice 1 presents the user-facing marketplace concept (\"The Global AI Marketplace\" with a call-to-action \"VISIT AI MARKETPLACE\") designed for users to explore AI services. Logic holds because a centralized list of services (the Registry) directly supports how a marketplace can present and enable discovery of services to users; the captions describe the Registry’s role as maintaining the service list and the marketplace’s role as the user interface for exploring those services.",

In Clip 3, a green circle highlights the 'Registry' box, visually emphasizing its role as a central record.
