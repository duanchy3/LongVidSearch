Step 2: Slice 21 shows a dark thick sauce/paste in a wooden bowl being scraped and stirred, described as a mixture including garlic. Conclusion: The crushed ingredient that later becomes part of the dark sauce is garlic.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 12 describes garlic cloves being crushed with a wooden pestle in a mortar. Step 2: Slice 21 describes a dark, thick sauce in a wooden bowl that appears to include garlic among its ingredients, which is then stirred. Logic holds because the same ingredient (garlic) is explicitly mentioned as being crushed first and later present in the sauce being stirred.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a person is crushing white, segmented cloves in a wooden mortar with a pestle; these are visually identifiable as garlic. In Clip 2, minced pieces of the same white, pungent ingredient (garlic) are being scraped from a knife into a dark sauce in a wooden bowl and then stirred in, confirming it is the same ingredient used in both steps."

Step 2: Slice 26 describes, in the same outdoor cooking context, a man adding a yellowish-green powder into a wooden bowl that already contains liquid and stirring it.

In Video 2, the same type of wooden bowl is shown, and after the juice is added (as seen in the close-up at 0:04-0:08), a metal grater is used to add a finely grated, yellowish-green powder (citrus zest) into the mixture before it is stirred."

Step 3: Slice 59 continues with the man walking alongside the goat in a rural field, with structures possibly being beehives, reinforcing the same type of setting. Logic holds because the proposed answer summarizes these two scenes: first a dog relaxing by beehives, then a man calmly interacting with a goat near beehives.",
