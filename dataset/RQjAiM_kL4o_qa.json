Step 2: Slice 83 states the street sign is written in both Arabic and French. Logic: The same two languages, Arabic and French, appear in both the infographic and the street signage.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (infographic) explicitly lists Arabic, Berber, and French as the three official languages of Morocco and features them prominently in its bar chart. Clip 2 (street sign) displays directional signs with text in both Arabic script (e.g., 'مراكش', 'الرباط') and French (e.g., 'MARRAKECH', 'RABAT', 'PLACE DES NATIONS UNIES'). Therefore, Arabic and French are the two languages that appear together in both visual contexts."
