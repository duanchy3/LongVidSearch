Step 2: Slice 6 earlier shows a person sitting at a desk near a window with a computer monitor, speakers, and office supplies, accompanied by the 'let's get sh*t done!' text, indicating a productivity-focused workspace. Logic holds because both scenes feature the same desk-and-monitors setup near a window, aligning the earlier productivity workspace with the later essay-writing context.",

Step 2: Evidence Slice 4 shows a later scene with the on-screen text 'Marinating pork belly for dinner,' indicating that pork belly is being prepared by marination for dinner.

In the second clip (0:13-0:17), the same type of meat is shown being cut and then mixed with a marinade in a pot, with an on-screen text overlay explicitly stating 'MARINATING PORK BELLY FOR DINNER'.

Step 2: Slice 10, following that theme, shows a bathroom scene where a person is drying their hair with a red towel, described as part of their evening routine.

Step 3: Slice 22 depicts the university day, including '[studying chinese in the library]' and text '- university is hella tough for me!', reflecting pressures of university life while studying Chinese.

Step 3: Slice 48 starts the next morning with a cat shown alongside the text \"good morning! Wednesday february 2, 2022,\" consistent with the same companion.
