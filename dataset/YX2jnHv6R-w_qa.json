        "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 7 shows a woman in urgent distress during a phone call and then moving briskly through a hospital-like corridor. Step 2: Slice 60 shows phone text messages and the woman speaking seriously on the phone in a car at night. Step 3: Slice 93 shows a woman in a white suit walking into a confrontation with men in black suits holding batons. Conclusion: Repeated phone-driven urgency culminates in decisive physical action on the street.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 7 and Slice 60 depict a woman experiencing urgent, serious tension tied to phone communication (phone call and text conversation). Step 2: Slice 93 shows a woman in a white suit walking into a tense, dangerous street scene and engaging in a fight with men holding weapons under neon-lit city lights. Step 3: The logic holds because the same video (“MY DEMON”) presents escalating narrative beats from phone-driven urgency to direct confrontation, and the visual details (urban night setting, recurring title) support continuity.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a woman is seen in distress while on the phone in a hospital setting. In Clip 2, another woman is shown on the phone in a car at night, looking tense. In Clip 3, a woman in a white suit walks purposefully down a neon-lit street toward a group of men, some holding sticks or weapons, culminating in a physical confrontation. The sequence visually links her earlier emotional state during phone calls to her later decisive, confrontational action."
