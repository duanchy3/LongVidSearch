    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 9 explicitly mentions an image labeled 'Historic Inner City Paramaribo (UNESCO),' confirming the UNESCO-labeled place shown. Step 2: Slice 10 states the video begins with an image of Fort Zeelandia and then transitions to multiple Paramaribo attractions (Waterkant, Independence Square, etc.), showing Fort Zeelandia presented within the travel-style segment alongside these attractions. Logic holds because both slices consistently describe the presenter and content, and the named sites match the question.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:05, an image of colonial-style buildings is shown with the explicit text overlay 'Historic inner city Paramaribo (UNESCO)'. In Clip 2, at 0:00, a separate image of a historic fort with a statue in front is displayed with the text 'Fort Zeelandia'. The video then proceeds to show other attractions like Waterkant and Independence Square, confirming that Fort Zeelandia is presented as another key historical site within the same travel segment."

Step 2: Slice 24 describes a man explaining the Suriname toad's unique reproductive process where it carries eggs on its back, highlighting unusual egg-carrying reproduction. Logic holds because the question asks for the labeled animal (white-faced saki) and the amphibian later explained for its egg-carrying reproduction (Suriname toad), both directly supported by the slices.",

In Video 2, a toad is introduced with the text 'Suriname Toad' and the narrator later explains its unique reproductive method where eggs are embedded in the mother's back, which is visually demonstrated with close-up shots of the toad's skin."

Step 2: Slice 34 shows the Suriname flag again with the text 'Sranan Tongo (Creole)' above it. The same presenter and setting link the slices, and despite minor descriptive variance of the flag, both clearly reference Suriname. Therefore, the language with the flag is Dutch, and the later Creole shown is Sranan Tongo.",

In the second clip, the same Suriname flag appears again, this time with the text 'Sranan Tongo (Creole)' written below it. Both pieces of information are explicitly shown on screen alongside the flag."

Step 2: Slice 50 shows a segment highlighting athletes including Anthony Nesty and Letitia Vriesde and discusses their Olympic achievements, which matches the description of the earlier slice introducing sports achievements by named Olympians. Logic holds because Slice 50 precedes Slice 52 and contains the athletes mentioned.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:20, the year '2019' is displayed next to a green checkmark and text that reads '(Sports passport for those of Surinamese descent)'. In Clip 2, starting at 0:04, images and text identifying Olympic swimmers Anthony Nesty (with his 1988 Gold and 1992 Bronze medals) and runner Letitia Vriesde (with her various championship medals) are shown, confirming this segment introduces their sports achievements."

Step 3: The consistent presenter, setting, and topic across slices link the unnamed 2010–2020/arrest warrant image in Slice 45 to Bouterse from Slice 43. Therefore, the leader is Bouterse, and the earlier slice framing the 2010 political alliance is the segment described in Slice 43.",

Step 2: Slice 78 again shows a woman named Cyanne in a similar indoor setting with a teal wall, window, and home-like elements (plants, framed pictures).

Slice 65 depicts a different setup (black background, different attire) and is not relevant.",

Step 2: Slice 62 presents images of multiple indigenous groups and labels them, including 'Kalina' among 'Kalina, Lokono, Arawak, Carib.'
