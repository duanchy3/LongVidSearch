    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 1 describes the presenter showing text about pronunciation ('Tong -a' with a red X) and then picking up and demonstrating a pair of tongs while emphasizing the correct pronunciation ('Tong-AHH!'). This supports that the object demonstrated during the correction is a pair of tongs. Step 2: Slice 2 mentions a small, static image of the flag of Tonga in the upper left corner while the same presenter continues speaking. This supports that the flag is Tonga’s. Logic holds because both slices consistently depict the same presenter (red polo, glasses, dark background) and the events can occur sequentially in the same video.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:06, the presenter holds up a pair of metal tongs while saying 'Tong-AHH!'. In Clip 2, starting at 0:03, the flag of Tonga (red field with a white canton containing a red cross) appears in the top-left corner of the screen as he continues speaking."
