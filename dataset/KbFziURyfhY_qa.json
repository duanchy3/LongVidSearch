Step 2: Slice 20 shows her sorting posters on the floor and explicitly framing a poster ('Time to frame!'), supporting 'then placed into frames.' Step 3: Slice 22 shows her hanging and adjusting framed artworks on the wall, confirming 'then hung and adjusted on the wall.' Step 4: Slice 22 also shows her standing on a chair to place artworks, and Slice 40 shows her standing on a chair or stool while hanging posters, supporting the tool used ('chair/stool') for reaching higher spots. The sequence from sorting to framing to hanging aligns across slices, and the clothing/name differences are acceptable VLM noise.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows the person sorting posters on the floor. Clip 2 shows them placing art into a frame. Clip 3 shows them standing on an office chair to hang framed art high on the wall. Clip 4 shows the final 'More wall art!' display, confirming the completion of the process."
