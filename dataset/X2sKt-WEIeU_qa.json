Step 2: Slice 51 shows, in the same kitchen context, a bowl of green sauce on the counter. While the sauce’s exact contents aren’t specified, the question only asks which herb was torn by hand; Slice 49 clearly identifies it as parsley. The scenes are consistent and support the identification.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the man is shown tearing green leafy herbs by hand and placing them into a blender cup. The herb's appearance, with its flat, serrated leaves, is characteristic of parsley. In Clip 2, a bowl of green sauce is on the counter next to the blender cup, which is the result of blending the herbs from Clip 1. The continuity between tearing the parsley and the resulting sauce confirms the answer."
