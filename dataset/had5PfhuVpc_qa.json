Step 2: Slice 15 shows a webpage with '1 Choice VPN' and the offer 'Get 83% OFF Now,' clearly suggesting a VPN promotion. Logic holds because the question asks for the device number from the animation and the later online offer indicating a VPN promo, both of which are directly stated in the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (0:08) clearly displays the text '10 DEVICES' over a tech-network animation. Clip 2 (0:07) shows a webpage for 'Private Internet Access' with a prominent red button stating 'Get 83% Off Now', confirming the VPN promotion."

Step 2: Slice 91 later shows an art gallery/studio space filled with people gathered around a central table, focused on a central activity led by someone, indicating a large crowd similarly engaged. Step 3: Both scenes are in open, communal indoor event spaces, supporting the 'same type of open event space' phrasing. The proposed answer matches Slice 91's description: a packed crowd focused on a central activity around a big table.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 3 shows a large, dense crowd of people in the same open event space seen in Clips 1 and 2. They are all focused on a central area where musicians are performing around a long table covered with an orange cloth. Many attendees are holding up their phones to record the performance, indicating a shared focus on the central activity, which matches the description in the original answer."

Step 2: Slice 75 shows a later buffet scene where a man serves himself food from a buffet table, with others also serving themselves, indicating communal dining. This supports the second part of the answer that a buffet line shows people serving themselves food as the meal-sharing outcome. Logic holds because the narrative connects private meal preparation to a public event space and then to communal food serving.",
