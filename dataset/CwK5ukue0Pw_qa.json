Step 2: Slice 46 shows a black-and-white cat with striking yellow eyes indoors near a black-and-white bird. Conclusion: The yellow-eyed black-and-white cat is the one later interacting with the bird.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 3 describes a close-up of a black-and-white cat with bright yellow eyes. Step 2: Slice 46 shows a black-and-white cat with striking yellow eyes indoors, interacting with a black-and-white bird. Logic holds because both slices consistently describe the same visual attributes (black-and-white fur, yellow eyes), and Slice 46 explicitly includes the indoor interaction with the bird, matching the question. Therefore, identifying the cat as 'the black-and-white cat with yellow eyes' is supported by the context.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a black-and-white cat with distinct yellow eyes is shown. In Video 2, the same black-and-white cat with yellow eyes is seen indoors, alongside another cat and a black-and-white bird (a magpie), confirming it is the subject of the question."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 53 states a vibrant vintage poster advertising \"Compagnie Française des Chocolats et des Thés.\" Step 2: Slice 7 mentions a painting titled \"Compagnie Francaise des Chocolats et des Thes.\" Despite missing diacritics, the titles match, indicating the same title appears in both segments. The logic holds given allowable VLM noise.",
        "visual_proof": "The title 'COMPAGNIE FRANCAISE DES CHOCOLATS ET DES THES' is clearly visible in the vintage poster shown in Video 1 (frames 0:13-0:21). The same poster and title are shown again in Video 2 at frame 0:03, confirming it appears in both segments."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 45 describes a close-up of a black cat’s face with glowing/reflective eyes in a dim setting, consistent with a real cat close-up. Step 2: Slice 21 explicitly states it is an impressionistic painting of a woman and a cat, matching the painting segment. Step 3: Slice 26 explicitly describes an animated scene with a white cat by a traditional Japanese-style window, matching the animated Japanese-style cat scene. The proposed examples align with these slices: black cat’s glowing eyes (Slice 45), impressionist woman-and-cat painting (Slice 21), and white cat by the Japanese window (Slice 26).",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a real black cat with glowing eyes in darkness. Clip 2 displays an impressionist-style painting of a woman and a cat. Clip 3 features an animated white cat sitting on a windowsill in a Japanese-style setting, followed by a painted black-and-white cat."
