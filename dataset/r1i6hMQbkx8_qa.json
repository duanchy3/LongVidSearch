        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 58 explicitly shows the text 'Sweden Stockholm Central,' identifying Stockholm Central Station as the labeled Swedish central station. Step 2: Evidence Slice 68 describes a museum with exhibits labeled 'Bärgningen' and 'Salvaging the Vasa,' focused on the salvage of the 17th-century Swedish warship Vasa, and shows the actual Vasa on display, clearly indicating a museum exhibit about salvaging the Vasa. Logic holds because both elements are directly described in the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 ends with a clear shot of a sign reading 'Stockholm Central' with 'Sweden' above it. Clip 2 opens with a sign that reads 'BÄRGNINGEN SALVAGING THE VASA,' indicating the exhibit's subject, which is consistent with the Vasa Museum in Stockholm."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 91 describes an advertisement again featuring CuriosityStream and Nebula, and explicitly notes the same URL 'curiositystream.com/simonclark'. Logic holds because the same promotional pairing and URL appear at the beginning (Slice 1) and again later (Slice 91), indicating recurrence.",
        "visual_proof": "Both clips show an identical promotional graphic. The left side features the 'Curiosity Stream' logo over a collage of video thumbnails, and the right side features the 'Nebula' logo over images of devices displaying content. A yellow plus sign is between them. At the bottom, the URL 'curiositystream.com/simonclark' is clearly visible in both clips."

Step 3: Slice 84 returns to the presenter speaking, framing it as explanation. Conclusion: EVs dominate and the action is plugging in a charger.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 81 states that in the pie chart of Norway’s 2021 car sales, 'pure electric vehicles' occupy the largest portion, emphasizing their dominance. Step 2: Slice 83 shows a close-up of a hand plugging an electric vehicle charger into a car, which is the physical action involving an EV shown shortly afterward. Logic holds because the first part identifies the dominant vehicle type, and the subsequent scene depicts the charger being plugged into an EV.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the pie chart for '2021 car sales (Norway)' clearly shows the largest segment, colored blue and labeled 'pure electric vehicles'. In Clip 2, a person's hand is shown plugging a charging cable into the port of a black electric car. These two visuals directly support the original answer."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 60 describes a webpage (also shown on a phone) featuring two cartoon faces and the text 'link below,' which matches the first visual of 'linking out.' Step 2: Slice 91 shows an advertisement for CuriosityStream and Nebula with a clear URL 'curiositystream.com/simonclark,' serving as an explicit promotional link associated with both platforms. Logic holds because the first is a generic 'link below' indicator, and the second is a specific URL tied to the dual-platform promotion.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (0:08-0:12) shows a screenshot of an Apple Podcasts page for 'The Wikicast' featuring two cartoon faces, overlaid with a red banner that reads 'link below'. Clip 2 (0:02-0:07) displays a promotional graphic for 'CuriosityStream + Nebula' with the explicit URL 'curiositystream.com/simonclark' at the bottom.

Step 2: Slice 17 shows the man on a train platform wearing a blue jacket and carrying a backpack, and states that the word 'GÖTEBORG' appears on the screen, indicating a location in Sweden. Logic holds because the video documents travel from Denmark to Sweden, and the platform scene with the backpack is tied to the Swedish city name shown on screen.",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip ends with the text 'KØBENHAVN' appearing over a shot of a station platform. The second clip shows the traveler on another platform with his backpack, and at 0:09, the text 'GÖTEBORG' is clearly displayed on screen, identifying the Swedish city."

Step 2: Slice 74 describes train scenes including boarding and a station with flags indicating an international feel, and then explicitly notes that the final scene shows 'Day 9' appearing on the screen. Logic holds because the first scene's overlay is directly 'Day 3' and the later train-related scene culminates with the 'Day 9' overlay, matching the question's descriptions.",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip shows a 'Day 3' overlay at the beginning, followed by scenes of a train journey with coastal views. The second clip later shows a 'Day 9' overlay as the traveler is seen at a station with international flags and signage (e.g., 'København H', 'Tickets to train, bus & metro'), indicating an international-station feel."
