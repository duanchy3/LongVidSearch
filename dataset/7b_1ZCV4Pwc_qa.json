Step 2: Slice 5 explicitly describes a deer grazing peacefully in a lush mountain meadow. Logic holds because these are two distinct wildlife moments showing calm animal presence in human-accessible settings: a road and a mountain meadow.",

Step 2: Evidence Slice 3 states that traffic is stopped because a group of bison is crossing a paved road, with vehicles halted to allow them to pass.

Clip 2 visually confirms two people equipped with backpacks and trekking poles walking through a narrow, rocky stream bed enclosed by high, smooth rock walls.
