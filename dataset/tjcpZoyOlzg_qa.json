        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 21 describes a large aerial operation labeled 'THE BATTLE OF CRETE' with vintage aircraft and several parachutes (yellow and white) descending, implying troop deployment—this matches the first sequence of troops descending by parachute in a large operation. Step 2: Slice 23 describes an animated, focused view of soldiers parachuting under yellow canopies, highlighting a central paratrooper—this matches the later focused view of paratroopers under yellow canopies. Logic holds because both slices explicitly depict parachute descents, with Slice 21 framing a broad operation and Slice 23 providing a close-up on yellow-canopy paratroopers.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually depicts multiple German military transport planes (Junkers Ju 52) flying in formation against a cloudy sky, with numerous paratroopers deploying from them under yellow parachutes. The text 'THE BATTLE OF CRETE' confirms the context. Clip 2 provides a close-up, focused view of individual soldiers in uniform descending under identical yellow parachutes against a clear blue sky, matching the description of a 'focused view'."

Step 2: Slice 90 describes a later animated map of the Battle of Red Cliffs presented on a crumpled paper background. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention the crumpled-paper map style, and Slice 90 occurs later than the beginning, thus repeating the style.",

Step 2: Slice 12 depicts a serene, earlier nighttime scene at sea with three ships sailing in formation under a starry sky, with hull numbers \"130\" and \"138\" visible. Logic holds because the question asks for the scene before the later battle, and Slice 12 matches the proposed answer precisely.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually depicts a serene night scene with a starry sky. Three small naval vessels are shown sailing in formation on calm waters. The hull numbers '130' and '138' are clearly visible on the sides of two of these ships. This peaceful scene directly precedes Clip 2, which shows a chaotic battle with larger U.S.-designated ships (e.g., 'US 507') burning and exploding."

Conclusion: The titled operation is Operation Tiger, which aligns with the later night naval combat sequence.",

Step 2: Slice 13 depicts a night naval battle with ships labeled 'USS 507' on fire. Since these slices are parts of the same video narrative, the operation first labeled in Slice 4 is linked to the later battle scene in Slice 13. Therefore, the operation is 'Operation Tiger'.",

Step 3: Slice 40 shows hands (in camouflage) pointing to a world map with a 'FIFA 2018' image, and explicitly notes the event's global relevance, establishing an international context. Logic holds because the first two scenes emphasize national/civic identity in Spain, while the third introduces a global sports event, tying the scenes together through the juxtaposition of national identity and international context.",

Clip 2 reinforces this with a crowd waving Spanish flags at a speaker. Clip 3 shows hands pointing at a world map that includes an image labeled 'FIFA 2018' near Europe, linking the national scene to an international event.
