        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 49 states the smartphone displays a padlock icon. Step 2: Slice 51 mentions a computer screen displaying a padlock icon indicating security/privacy. Logic holds because both the animated phone and the computer security imagery feature the same padlock symbol.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the animated phone graphic at 0:01-0:06 displays a green padlock icon on a shield. In Clip 2, the computer security imagery at 0:36-0:42 shows a pixelated padlock icon next to 'https://' in a browser bar. Both visuals prominently feature a padlock symbol to represent security."

Conclusion: The technology is meant to enable earlier warnings and improved disaster response to mitigate harm.",

Step 2: Slice 3 reinforces this with on-screen text 'Early Tornado Warning System.' Step 3: Slice 36 depicts a drone capturing footage near a tornado and over the damaged neighborhood, emphasizing its role in disaster response and documentation. Step 4: Slice 30 shows the real-world tornado devastation, providing the consequence context. Logic holds because the program first showcases kids' drone-focused warning technology, then illustrates drones operating in actual tornado scenarios and aftermath, and the stated roles include understanding/responding, which supports the intended outcome of earlier warning and better response.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 & 2 show a young boy presenting his 'Revere: Early Tornado Warning System' project with a drone at a science fair. Clip 3 shows a close-up of the drone's electronics and a phone app displaying 'Tornado Risk', followed by footage of a tornado with text 'UP TO 40 MINUTES' and aerial shots of destruction. Clip 4 shows people sifting through rubble. The sequence visually links the children's STEM project (drones) to the real-world problem (tornado devastation), with the 'UP TO 40 MINUTES' text strongly implying the intended outcome is to provide more lead time for warnings to mitigate the shown destruction."
