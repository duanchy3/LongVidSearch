Step 2: Slice 21 describes a man in a white shirt removing his hat and tossing it aside, followed by a scene with three people engaged in discussion. This supports that a different presenter tosses a hat before the group discussion. Logic holds because the two scenes involve different individuals and the actions match the question.",
