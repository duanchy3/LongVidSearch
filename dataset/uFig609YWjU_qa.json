    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 3 shows a TV screen with the caption 'Cigarette Ad Ban Jan 1st 1971,' indicating the ban took effect on January 1, 1971. Step 2: Slice 7 shows a retro TV promoting the sitcom 'All in the Family' with the date 'Jan. 12th 1971' for its premiere. Step 3: Comparing the dates, January 1 precedes January 12. Thus, the cigarette ad ban happened first.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays text on a retro TV screen stating 'Cigarette Ad Ban' with the date 'Jan. 1st 1971'. Clip 2 displays text on the same retro TV screen stating 'All in the Family Premieres' with the date 'Jan. 12th 1971'. The dates are clearly visible and confirm the chronological order."
