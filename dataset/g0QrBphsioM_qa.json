Step 2: Slice 1 shows the presenter mentioning he is 1/8th French and wanting to honor his heritage, which ties into cultural/national aspects that fall under the broader geography theme.

Step 2: Slice 12 presents a speaker defining the political categories (regions vs collectivities) and their governance differences.
