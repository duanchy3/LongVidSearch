Step 2: Slice 74 shows a uniformed soldier tenderly handling a horse’s bridle in a snowy/wintry courtyard. Conclusion: The bait is an apple, and the later gesture is gentle, affectionate bridle-holding/interaction.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 2 describes a young man kneeling and holding out an apple to a brown horse, clearly indicating the food used to lure the horse is an apple. Step 2: Slice 74 describes a soldier gently holding the horse’s bridle and looking up at it with a warm expression in a wintry outdoor setting, which matches the affectionate gesture stated. Logic holds because both details are explicitly stated in the respective slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the young man is clearly holding a red apple in his outstretched hand as he kneels before the brown horse in the field. In Clip 2, a soldier in uniform is seen gently holding the horse's bridle with both hands while looking up at its face with a tender expression."

Step 2: Slice 75 explicitly shows an older bearded man handing a brown leather bag to a young man in military uniform. Logic holds because both elements directly match the question's two parts and are supported by the respective slices.",

In Clip 2, the same older bearded man (now with white hair) is shown handing a brown leather bag to a young man in a military uniform.

Conclusion: Formation occurs in a courtyard; the later march is toward a windmill.",

Step 2: Slice 40 shows soldiers marching through a dense forest and approaching a windmill, a visible landmark. Logic holds because the first setting matches the courtyard formation and the later setting matches the forest march toward the windmill.",

Clip 2 shows soldiers marching in a dense, dark forest, and the final shot of this clip reveals a windmill in the distance across a body of water, indicating it is their direction of travel."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 32 states a close-up of a gun muzzle emitting a bright flash and smoke, indicating it has been fired, immediately before showing horses galloping through the forest. This supports that a gun is fired (muzzle flash) before the horses flee. Step 2: Evidence Slice 40 describes a large group of soldiers marching through a dense forest and explicitly notes they are equipped with rifles. This supports that the marching soldiers carry rifles. Logic holds because both details are directly stated in the respective slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a close-up of a rifle barrel shows smoke and a muzzle flash as it fires. Immediately after, horses are seen fleeing through a forest. In Video 2, during the forest march, soldiers are clearly carrying long rifles with bayonets attached, consistent with early 20th-century military equipment."

Step 2: Slice 8 describes a dim stable/barn where one man holds another by the throat during a physical altercation.

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 20 shows an older man with a white beard emotionally connected to a horse on a village street while soldiers are involved, matching the claim that he is first shown anxiously attached to the horse during soldiers’ involvement. Step 2: Slice 75 shows the older bearded man handing a brown leather bag to a young man in military uniform, aligning with the statement that he later gives a brown leather bag to a young soldier. Step 3: Slice 55 shows the older bearded man standing beside a black horse near a windmill with a group moving, supporting the claim that he finally appears by a windmill with a black horse as a group gathers or moves. The visual attributes and actions consistently link the figure across slices.",
