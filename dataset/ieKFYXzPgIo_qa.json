Step 2: Slice 24 later shows the woman with green hair in a bathroom, bending over a sink, seemingly washing her hair.

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 22 states that while she is lying on a bed looking at a tablet, the on-screen text says 'watching my hero academia', explicitly identifying the anime. Step 2: Slice 23 shows the same woman in an orange shirt lying on a bed with a tablet, and notes her hair is wrapped in plastic wrap. Logic holds because both slices depict the same setting (bed, tablet, orange shirt), and Slice 23 presents the hair-related situation while she remains in bed with the tablet, consistent with 'soon after.'",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, at 0:10, text on screen explicitly states 'watching my hero academia' while she is lying in bed with a tablet. In the same clip, at 0:12, she is still in bed with the tablet, and her hair is visibly wrapped in clear plastic wrap. This directly confirms both parts of the original answer."

Step 2: Slice 18 later describes the same-looking person (orange T-shirt, round glasses, necklace, similar room) with hair that is dark with streaks of pink, styled in two braids. Logic holds because the later slice explicitly mentions pink streaks, indicating added pink coloring, and the braids detail aligns with the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In both clips, the woman is seen with distinct, vibrant pink streaks in her dark hair. In Clip 1, a pink streak is visible near her left ear as she brushes her hair.

Step 3: Slice 51 continues with the same woman (white top, similar room) and focuses on nails, then explicitly transitions to a title card \"TIME FOR MY OutFit!\", showing the move to an outfit segment. Hair color: Slices 50 and 51 explicitly describe the woman having pink/pink-tipped hair, and there is no contradiction in Slice 33.
