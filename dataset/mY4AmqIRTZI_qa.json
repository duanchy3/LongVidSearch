Step 2: Slice 60 says, in the split-screen segment, the person on the right is using blue tongs to mix pasta with a creamy sauce in a bowl. Logic holds because both scenes explicitly mention blue tongs used in the respective actions.",

Step 2: Immediately after, Slice 42 shows the man holding a bowl covered with aluminum foil and a yellow spray bottle, and he sprays the bowl. Step 3: Slice 43 shows the man placing ground meat into a smaller bowl lined with aluminum foil and pressing it down, which aligns with the idea that the sprayed bowl/foil is being prepared for food. Step 4: Slice 33 also mentions a can of cooking spray visible on the counter during the cooking prep context, reinforcing that the spray is for cooking. Logic holds because the time jump directly precedes the spraying action, and in this cooking context, spraying foil-lined bowls is reasonably implied to be greasing to prevent sticking.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 2 begins with the text 'a long time later', establishing a time jump. The subsequent frames show the man spraying a foil-lined bowl with a yellow can, which is a common cooking spray used for greasing.
