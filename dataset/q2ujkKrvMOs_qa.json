Step 2: Slice 35 mentions that on the coffee table there are several taxidermy animals, including a fox, during a discussion. Logic holds because the fox appears first as a quirky decoration and later among multiple taxidermy animals on the coffee table.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (0:06-0:10), a taxidermy fox is clearly visible sitting on the left side of the black couch. In Clip 2 (0:00-0:07), the same taxidermy fox is still present on the couch, while other taxidermy animals like a bird and a squirrel are now on the coffee table for discussion. The fox serves as both an early set decoration and part of the group of specimens later in the scene."

Logic holds because the animal identified by its scientific name in Slice 6 (a squirrel) is later shown as a squirrel holding the 'Sci' flag in Slice 34.",

In Clip 2, the same type of squirrel is shown holding a small flag with the 'Sci' logo. The visual continuity and matching species confirm the answer."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 42 explicitly identifies the animal: a green parrot named Zoe, specified as a Red Lored Amazon Parrot (Amazona autumnalis), satisfying the 'species identification on-screen' part. Step 2: Slice 45 shows a close-up interaction with the same type of green parrot, noting gentle interaction and possible offering of food. Step 3: Slice 56 clearly shows the parrot being fed by hand, confirming the feeding interaction. The visual attributes (green parrot with red patch) are consistent across slices, linking the identification to the later close-up feeding scene.",

Step 2: Slice 35 explicitly lists several taxidermy animals on the coffee table, including a fox, reinforcing the early focus on taxidermy. Step 3: Slice 48 shows a later scene with a guest holding a green parrot, which is a live animal and the clear central focus of the interaction. Logic holds because the early theme centers on taxidermy (with a fox noted), and later the focus shifts to a live green parrot during the guest segment.",

Step 2: Slice 68 shows the handler holding the parrot’s foot to demonstrate its structure.

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 68 states the video begins with a close-up of a green parrot on a woman's hand, where she gently holds the parrot's foot, highlighting its zygodactyl feet—this satisfies 'carefully handled in close-up.' Step 2: Slice 69 specifies that on-screen text 'zygodactyl feet' appears while showing the same green parrot, highlighting the anatomical feature. Step 3: Slice 44 also shows a woman interacting affectionately with a green parrot, consistent with the setting, though the key evidence is in Slices 68 and 69. The logic holds because both slices consistently refer to a green parrot being closely handled and then labeled for its zygodactyl feet with on-screen text.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a woman in close-up carefully handling a green parrot. Clip 2 provides a close-up of the parrot's foot gripping her finger, followed by a wider shot where on-screen text explicitly labels 'zygodactyl feet' while the parrot is still perched on her hand. Clip 3 reinforces this with another close-up of the parrot and its foot, again with the 'zygodactyl feet' text visible."
