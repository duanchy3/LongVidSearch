        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 24 includes the news headline 'Gotti Convicted' (April 2, 1992) but does not mention a funeral or death date. Step 2: Slice 26 also shows 'Gotti Convicted' and then explicitly transitions to a funeral procession with text noting the death of the 'Teflon Don' on June 10, 2002. Logic holds because Slice 26 directly connects the conviction to the later funeral and death date.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a news headline 'Gotti Convicted Apr. 2, 1992'. Clip 2, which occurs later in the video's timeline, shows a funeral scene with pallbearers carrying a coffin.

Step 2: The question asks which cartoon character is shown in a colorful animation after a separate segment about the creator; Slice 18 provides that sequence (creator segment followed by animation). Step 3: Although Slice 15 mentions the death of the voice actor rather than the creator, the identity of the cartoon character shown in the colorful animation is clearly stated in Slice 18 as Woody Woodpecker. Therefore, the context supports the proposed answer.",

In Video 2, at 0:06, the name 'Michelangelo' appears on a computer screen's boot-up message.

Step 3: Slice 87 presents an election-win montage featuring Clinton celebrating and a statistical overview of vote percentages (Texas: Clinton 41%, Bush 40%, Perot 19%), which aligns with the election results context.
