Step 2: Slice 24 shows on-screen text '1000 and growing (Wild)' about elephants, indicating a wild population figure. Step 3: The presenter is consistently described (hat, red/maroon shirt, black background), so the slices logically refer to the same segment. Therefore, the captivity statistic (3,500) is later contrasted with the wild-population statistic ('1000 and growing').",
