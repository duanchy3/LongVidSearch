Step 2: Evidence Slice 22 shows a later segment with on-screen text stating, \"it's important to note that NO, you are not monitored the whole time,\" which is a clear reassurance about surveillance. Logic holds because the later reassurance directly addresses and moderates the initial concern about being watched by stating monitoring is not constant.",

Clip 2 (0:05-0:06) shows the creator speaking on camera with subtitles that read, 'NO, you are not monitored the whole time,' directly addressing and countering the earlier concern about constant surveillance."

    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 begins with a title card 'DAY 2 (The burning fortress) \"Yangykala\"', introducing the theme. Clip 2 then shows a large, flaming pit in a desert landscape, which is visually consistent with the 'burning' theme. Over this scene, the text 'DARVAZA' is superimposed, explicitly labeling the location. The combination of the thematic introduction in Clip 1 and the explicit on-screen label in Clip 2 confirms that Darvaza is the attraction being referred to."

Step 3: Slice 54 depicts the flaming crater with on-screen text including \"to prevent poisonous gases from spreading\", which provides the explanation for the ignition. The logic holds because the progression goes from a thematic intro (burning fortress) to the specific site (Darvaza) and then to the reason it was ignited (to prevent poisonous gases from spreading).",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 starts with the title 'DAY 2 (The burning fortress) \"Yangykala\"', setting a thematic premise. Clip 2 visually identifies the location as 'DARVAZA' with shots of the flaming crater and people observing it.
