Logic holds because the question asks for the exhibition named in the opening title cards and the later painting’s title and year, both of which are directly provided in the slices.",

Step 2: Slice 49 describes a later segment featuring a single large abstract painting by Cecily Brown titled 'Saboteur Four Times' with the year 2019. Logic holds because the earlier part asks for a title from the three-work set (e.g., 'Paradise (Fighting Lions)'), and the later part asks for the single abstract work and its year ('Saboteur Four Times' (2019)), both directly supported by the slices.",

        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays the painting titled 'Cecily Brown, Paradise (Fighting Lions), 2015' as a single piece. Clip 2 displays the painting titled 'Cecily Brown, Saboteur Four Times, 2019', which is visually composed of four distinct panels arranged side-by-side. The original answer incorrectly describes 'Paradise (Fighting Lions)' as part of a three-work set and misidentifies the later work as a single large abstract painting."
