        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 47 shows a kitchen moment where the woman is holding a box labeled 'Mochi' and appears to be eating from it. Step 2: The same slice notes text overlays including 'midnight snack,' indicating that the item being eaten is presented as the midnight snack. Step 3: Slice 12 mentions Pocky, but there is no link to 'midnight snack' there. Therefore, the item shown in the kitchen that later appears as the woman's midnight snack is Mochi.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the woman is seen in the kitchen, but no mochi is shown. However, in Clip 2, she retrieves a box of 'Mochi Ice Cream' from the freezer at 1 AM, as indicated by the on-screen text, and proceeds to eat it. The question asks which snack item *shown during a kitchen moment* later appears as the midnight snack. While mochi isn't shown in Clip 1, the context implies the kitchen moments are part of the same continuous video. The only snack explicitly identified and consumed as a 'midnight snack' in the provided clips is the mochi ice cream."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 13 explicitly describes making coffee using a French press during the mid-day segment, including adding grounds and pouring hot water into the press. Step 2: Slice 33 states that a hand holding a French press pours hot coffee into a mug in a breakfast setting. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention and depict a French press being used in the respective segments.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a clear glass coffee maker with a metal plunger and lid is shown being used to brew coffee; this is a French press. In Video 2, the same type of device (glass carafe with a plunger mechanism) is used to pour coffee into a mug. The visual design, including the handle, glass body, and plunger top, is consistent across both clips, confirming it is a French press."

Step 2: Slice 45 shows a pot where green leafy vegetables are being stirred and states they appear to be spinach or a similar leafy green. This directly answers the question about the leafy green side shown being stirred. The proposed answer ('Spinach or similar leafy greens') aligns with the explicit wording in Slice 45.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a person is shown placing lemon slices on seasoned salmon. In Video 2, fresh green leaves are added to a pot on the stove and then stirred with chopsticks; these leaves are visually identifiable as spinach due to their shape, color, and texture."

Step 2: Slice 31 shows two waffles being prepared with butter and strawberry jam and then combined into a sandwich. Logic holds because both slices consistently reference waffles as the item being heated and then used to make a sandwich with butter and jam.",

Clip 2 shows the same type of waffles being taken out, placed on a plate, and one is spread with strawberry jam (Bonne Maman brand) while butter is also present on the counter, indicating they are being prepared as a sandwich."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 42 shows salmon being placed on foil, seasoned with herbs/spices, and topped with lemon slices—this supports the preparation/seasoning phase. Step 2: Slice 44 shows a foil-covered baking tray being removed from an oven, indicating a baked/handled cooked item; while it doesn’t explicitly state salmon, the use of foil and oven aligns logically with the prior prep and represents the cooking step. Step 3: Slice 46 shows a composed bowl with white rice, greens, slices of salmon, and lemon wedges, matching the presentation as a ready-to-eat dish. The proposed answer summarizes these stages without adding unsupported specifics.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows raw salmon being seasoned with herbs and topped with lemon slices on foil. Clip 2 shows the person placing the foil-wrapped salmon into an oven and later removing it, indicating a baking/cooking process.

Step 2: Slice 47 shows a woman lying on a bed with a black-and-white cat sleeping beside her, indicating a calm, resting scene. Logic holds because the first moment clearly depicts active play with a blue object, and the second moment shows the cat calmly present during rest on a bed.",

Step 3: Slice 76 depicts a Krispy Kreme bag and a glazed donut being eaten outside in a park-like environment.
