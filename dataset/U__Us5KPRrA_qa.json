Step 2: Evidence Slice 2 mentions the show is titled 'Heart of the Matter' and explicitly notes a text overlay identifying 'Steven Chia, HOST, HEART OF THE MATTER.' Logic holds because the beginning confirms the show title and later on-screen identification confirms the host as Steven Chia.",

Therefore, the prop on the table is a decorative globe. Step 2: Slice 92 explicitly mentions an end-credit promotional segment encouraging viewers to listen to full episodes on CNA.ASIA/LISTEN, with logos for platforms like Spotify and Google Podcasts, which supports the call-to-action described. Logic holds because both details are directly stated in the provided slices and align with the proposed answer.",
