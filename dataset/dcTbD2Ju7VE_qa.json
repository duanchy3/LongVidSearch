Step 2: Evidence Slice 17 shows a document titled 'Aviation Investigative Preliminary Report' with the finding 'FOUR BOLTS WERE MISSING,' which clearly suggests a mechanical/assembly issue. The two slices logically relate to the same aviation incident coverage, supporting both parts of the proposed answer.",

Step 2: Evidence Slice 21 shows interior damage with a close-up of a ceiling panel that is damaged, exposing insulation, and a text overlay stating that a part of the plane's overhead panel came loose into the cabin. Logic holds because the question asks for the distinctive object next to the plane (orange ladder) and the later interior damage highlighted with text (loose overhead panel with exposed insulation), both explicitly supported by the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:05), an orange maintenance scaffold/ladder is clearly visible next to the Alaska Airlines plane. In Video 2 (0:03-0:08), the interior footage shows a large, damaged section of the overhead cabin ceiling with white insulation material visibly exposed and dangling, which is consistent with the text overlay mentioning 'A part of the plane flew off'."
