    "question": "A male presenter in a straw hat discusses biodiversity with animal cutaways; later a long-haired, bearded presenter discusses wildlife with dolphin and crocodile insets; and later again an owl inset appears while the same long-haired presenter talks. What animals are featured across these three moments?",
    "answer": "Spiny spider, frogmouth, skink, leaf frogs, and fruit bat (biodiversity cutaways), dolphins and a saltwater crocodile, and an owl inset.",

The original answer incorrectly listed 'giant bats' instead of the visually confirmed 'fruit bat'."

    "question": "Which island or province name is directly associated with a saltwater crocodile segment, and which earlier geography segment also names that same island as part of the islands’ trenches and features?",
    "answer": "San Cristobal; it is also referenced earlier in the geography segment via the San Cristobal Trench.",

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 24 explicitly shows an inset image of a saltwater crocodile with the text 'San Cristobal saltwater crocs,' directly associating the saltwater crocodile segment with San Cristobal. Step 2: Slice 18 mentions geological features including the 'San Cristobal Trench' in the earlier geography segment, thereby naming the same island/province. Logic holds because both slices explicitly reference 'San Cristobal' in their respective contexts.",
    "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:01), a picture of a saltwater crocodile is shown with the text 'San Cristobal saltwater crocs'. In Video 2 (0:09-0:10), the map displays the 'San Cristobal Trench' as a major geological feature near the Solomon Islands, directly associating the name 'San Cristobal' with both the crocodiles and the trench."
