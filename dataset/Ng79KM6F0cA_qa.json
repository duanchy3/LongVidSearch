Step 2: Slice 12 describes a man presenting at a transparent podium, wearing a purple blazer, light blue shirt, and glasses. Step 3: The shared details (transparent podium, formal presentation setting) logically link the presenter in Slice 8 to the man described in Slice 12. Step 4: The proposed answer identifies the presenter as \"the man presenting 'The John Blanke Project'\" and specifies the distinctive clothing (purple blazer, light blue shirt, glasses) to track him later, which matches Slice 12. Therefore, the context fully supports the answer.",

Although there is a minor discrepancy about the petition year (1511 vs 1512), per the instruction to handle VLM noise, the core timeline information is clearly repeated. Logic holds because both slices refer to the same titled content and timeline presented first as a slide and later as a static document display.",

Step 2: Slice 22 shows the same man (purple blazer, glasses) at the podium with a laptop and microphone, and again mentions the vase with white flowers in the same dimly lit setting, indicating repeated appearances at the podium. Step 3: The connection holds because the distinctive setup (vase with white flowers, podium, laptop) and the man's consistent attire link the candle-including segment to his repeated podium shots, with the Dell laptop identified in Slice 17 and the laptop presence maintained in Slice 22.",
