Step 3: Since Slice 7 establishes the large-window city view as part of the beginning of the video, and Slice 42 is another scene with no indication of being earlier, the city-view at the large window in the transit hub occurs earlier than the rooftop terrace view.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (ID: 7) shows a man with luggage at a train station platform and then ascending an escalator into a large, busy hall with high ceilings, pillars, and food court-style seating — consistent with a transit hub. Clip 2 (ID: 42) shows people on an outdoor rooftop terrace with tables, glass railings, and a clear panoramic city view under a bright sky. Since these clips are from the same continuous video and Clip 1 precedes Clip 2 chronologically, the transit hub scene occurs earlier."
