Step 2: Slice 24 shows the finished baked dish being garnished with finely chopped green herbs described as possibly parsley or dill. Logic holds because the earlier slice clearly identifies dill as the herb being chopped, and the later garnish is consistent with dill (and includes dill as a stated possibility). No conflicting herb is mentioned being chopped, so the chopped dill aligns with the garnish.",
