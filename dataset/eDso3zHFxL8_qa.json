Step 2: The Scene Breakdown explicitly says the presenter introduces Guinea-Bissau and highlights it as 'Africa's least visited country,' supported by visuals like the Bijagos archipelago off Guinea-Bissau.

The second clip, at 0:00, shows the speaker again with the flag of Guinea-Bissau and the subtitle 'Africa's least visited country,' confirming the association. The initial mention of 'Guinea' in the context of major rivers (0:00-0:08) is visually distinct from the later, explicit labeling of 'Guinea Bissau' as the least visited country."

Step 3: Although Slice 8 later mentions Guinea, the question specifically references the segment about an indigenous-majority Central American country with Mayan statues, which aligns with Slice 7. Therefore, the proposed answer matches both required elements.",
