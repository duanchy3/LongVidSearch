Step 2: Slice 12 shows a man in a white shirt and black pants precariously lying on a windowsill outside an open window. Conclusion: The party violence is followed by a later life-threatening window peril.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 11 describes a formal party with dancing that is interrupted when a man in a suit is violently thrown across the room, crashes into a table, and has blood on his head. Step 2: Slice 12 shows a man in a precarious, life-threatening position lying partially out of an open window on a windowsill, with a cityscape visible outside, indicating an urban setting and height. Step 3: The logic connects the violent incident at the party to a later scene showing a man in an even more dangerous position high above the city. The proposed answer matches these details: the violent throw and the later windowsill position above the city.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a man in a suit is seen being thrown across a hallway and crashing into a table, resulting in a bloody head wound. In Clip 2, the same man is shown lying on his back, partially hanging out of a high-rise window with city lights visible far below, indicating he is in a dangerous position high above the city."

Step 2: Slice 51 shows a text message reading 'They are not what you think 2058 Ludlow,' which provides a specific address to go next. Logic holds because the first clue indicates activity inside the house, and the later clue gives a location.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows muddy footprints on a white carpet near a staircase, indicating someone has tracked dirt inside. Clip 2 shows a cell phone displaying a text message from an unknown sender that reads, 'They are not what you think 2058 Ludlow,' providing a specific address."
