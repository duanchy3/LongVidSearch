Step 2: Slice 51 depicts a hand opening a door, holding a white ceramic mug with a frothy beverage (likely a latte/cappuccino) and placing it on a table in a cozy interior, i.e., another room. Logic holds because the frothy coffee made in the kitchen is then carried and set down elsewhere, and the description explicitly identifies it as a frothy coffee drink.",
