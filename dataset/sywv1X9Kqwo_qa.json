Step 2: Slice 12 shows the same man later pouring dough into a container and pressing it down, explicitly identifying it as a large glass container.

In Clip 2, he pours dough from a metal bowl into this same container and presses it down. The container is clearly made of plastic, not glass, as evidenced by its slight flexibility and the way light reflects off its surface."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 47 describes a man in a white shirt preparing a pizza in a kitchen, topping it with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Step 2: Slice 50 shows (likely the same) man using a long-handled pizza peel to slide a freshly prepared pizza into an outdoor Gozney oven. Logic holds because the second slice explicitly names the tool used to slide the pizza into the oven, and the first slice establishes the preparation of the pizza with the specified toppings.",

Step 2: Slice 59 shows the same kitchen scene with the person in a white shirt removing a pizza from the oven that has tomato sauce, cheese, and visible green herbs described as possibly basil. Logic holds because the topping added (basil) in Slice 47 corresponds to the green herbs seen on the pizza when it is removed from the oven in Slice 59, and the consistent setting and clothing indicate continuity.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the chef is seen adding fresh green basil leaves to the pizza after spreading the sauce and cheese. In Clip 2, when the pizza is placed into the oven, these same green basil leaves are clearly visible on top of the uncooked pizza. Although the final baked pizza being removed from the oven is not shown in the provided clips, the question asks what topping is still visible as green herbs *when the baked pizza is later removed*. The visual evidence confirms that basil was added and is present as green herbs before baking, which logically implies it would be the herb visible after baking, even if slightly wilted. The context of making a classic Margherita pizza strongly supports this."

Step 2: Slice 3 corroborates the presence of a small blue bowl filled with salt next to another bowl with other ingredients, reinforcing the identification of salt and a flour-based mixture. Step 3: Slice 8 mentions the liquid being poured from a blue bottle into flour, consistent with Slice 7’s blue container. Logic holds because multiple slices consistently describe two powdered contents (flour mixture and salt) and a blue vessel (container/bottle) used to pour the liquid.",
