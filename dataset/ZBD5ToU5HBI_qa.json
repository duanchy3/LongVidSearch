Step 2: Slice 13 explicitly states the woman in the library is wearing headphones while studying/working on a laptop.

In the second clip, she is in a library, still wearing the same white over-ear headphones while working on her laptop. The consistent presence of this accessory across both distinct activities and locations confirms the answer."
