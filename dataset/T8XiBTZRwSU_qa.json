Step 3: Slice 30 shows an orange-and-white toy opened via a compartment. Step 4: Slice 92 shows a large black bag opened and items removed (e.g., headphones).

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 4 describes a woman opening a small bowl/container to reveal powder or granules, matching the first reveal. Step 2: Slice 10 shows an illustrated box (IZU SHABOTEN ZOO) being opened to reveal a plush toy, matching the second reveal. Step 3: Slice 30 shows an orange-and-white toy compartment being opened to reveal its interior (with a sticker), matching the third reveal. Step 4: Slice 92 shows a large black bag from which items, including headphones, are removed; removing items implies the bag was opened, matching the fourth reveal. The visual attributes across slices align, and each action is explicitly supported.",
