Step 2: Slice 47 presents a census-style visualization quantifying national identities in Northern Ireland with categories British only, Irish only, Northern Irish only, and Other. Step 3: Slice 48 further shows a comparative grid of percentages for British Only and Irish Only between 2011 and 2022. Logic holds because the video moves from an individual expressing feeling British to later statistical graphics quantifying identity categories, including the ones named in the answer.",

Clips 2 and 3 display official census graphics from 2011 and 2022 that quantify the percentages of people identifying as 'British only,' 'Irish only,' 'Northern Irish only,' and 'Other,' directly visualizing the statistical context for the personal sentiment expressed in Clip 1."

Clip 3 presents census data visualizations showing divided national identities ('British only,' 'Irish only,' etc.) in Northern Ireland, directly addressing identity splits.
