Step 2: Slice 38 shows the red-scarf blonde woman speaking with a mustached man outside a building. Step 3: Slice 39 shows the same red-scarf woman holding a document while a man places a hand on her shoulder. Step 4: Slice 40 provides a key contextual title card for Miller’s Court, anchoring the timeline/location near these interactions. Conclusion: The red-scarf woman is tracked across emotional trauma, discussion, documentation, and then a major named crime-location context.",

Step 2: Slice 38 shows the same red-scarf woman speaking with a mustached man in a calm conversation. Step 3: Slice 39 shows the red-scarf woman holding a document while a man has his hand on her shoulder. Step 4: Slice 40 presents a location/date title card: London, Friday, November 9, 1888, at 13 Miller's Court, off Dorset Street, Spitalfields, which sets major contextual framing near that part of the story. The proposed answer matches these elements and sequence.",
