Step 3: Slice 3 explicitly introduces a new, concrete danger: an individual in the aisle holding a gun, moving with authority and creating a hijacking-like threat. Step 4: Therefore, the context supports that after the calm cart-pushing, the new danger is the presence of an armed man in the cabin.",

Step 3: Slice 14 further reinforces high-stakes coordination in a high-tech environment with numerous screens and urgent conversation, connecting to operations involving an aircraft.
