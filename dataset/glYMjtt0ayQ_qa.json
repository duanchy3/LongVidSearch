        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 15 explicitly states that a newspaper front page from The Daily Mail shows the headline '£750,000 DEAL SPARKS NEW BATTLE WITH POST OFFICE VICTIMS.' Step 2: Evidence Slice 44 describes the studio discussion where a large background screen displays the front page of The Daily Mail during the 'Press Preview' segment. The identity of the newspaper matches across both slices, fulfilling the question's criteria that the same newspaper with the mentioned headline later appears again as a large background screen. Any discrepancy in the amount in Slice 44 is irrelevant to identifying the newspaper and is likely VLM noise.",
        "visual_proof": "In both clips, the front page of the 'Daily Mail' is clearly visible in the 'Front Pages' panel on the right side of the screen. The headline reads '£75,000 DEAL SPARKS NEW BATTLE WITH POST OFFICE VICTIMS'. In Clip 2, this same Daily Mail front page is displayed as a large image on the screen behind the three presenters at the studio table."

Step 3: Slice 19 shows her again beside a Financial Times front page with the same setup, confirming continuity.
