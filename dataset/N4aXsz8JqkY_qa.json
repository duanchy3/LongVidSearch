        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 44 states the man is skewering a substantial piece of raw meat, explicitly described as raw and being prepared for roasting. Step 2: Slice 74 describes the man carving a roasted meat dish mounted on a spit, noting he carefully slices the meat. Logic holds because the meat transitions from raw (preparation/skewering) to roasted/cooked (on the spit) and then is carved/sliced, matching the proposed state change.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the meat is visibly raw, red, and being secured with ropes and skewers onto a spit. In Clip 2, the same piece of meat is shown on the table with a browned, crispy, roasted exterior, indicating it has been cooked. The man is then actively carving it into slices, confirming the state change from raw to cooked to carved."

Step 2: Slice 61 shows the person washing the red berries in the wooden bowl at a fountain, resulting in clean berries. Step 3: Slice 63 shows the red berries placed in a glass teapot, with hot water poured from a samovar into the teapot, indicating they are being infused. The sequence supports the answer: picked, washed, then put into a glass teapot and infused with hot water.",

Logic holds because both slices clearly identify ducks, first as a pair on land and later as a larger group in water.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:09), two white birds and one brown bird, identifiable as ducks by their body shape and behavior, are seen grazing in a grassy field. In Video 2 (0:02), a larger group of dark-colored ducks, including ducklings, are swimming in a pond with an adult duck leading them. The visual characteristics and context in both clips confirm they are ducks."

Step 2: Slice 90 mentions a dog lying on the grass near the children’s outdoor meal area. Logic holds because both slices clearly identify a dog in the described contexts, matching the question’s two appearances.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a black-and-white dog is seen resting in the grass with a mountainous background (0:04). In Video 2, the same dog is shown again lying calmly in the grass near a wooden fence and garden area (0:04), which is adjacent to the outdoor dining scene with children (0:00-0:03). The consistent appearance and markings of the dog confirm it is the same animal appearing in both contexts."
