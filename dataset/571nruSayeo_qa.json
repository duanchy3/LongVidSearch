        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 18 describes armed individuals, explicitly noting one person wearing a mask with a skull design, indicating masks are used by those holding firearms. Step 2: Slice 20 states some individuals wear masks or bandanas over their faces and later notes a child wearing a mask. Logic holds because both slices identify masks/face coverings used by armed individuals and by the child, making a face covering/mask the common concealment item.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, multiple armed individuals are seen wearing bandanas or masks covering their faces; one prominently wears a skull-patterned mask. In Clip 2, at 0:11-0:12, a child is visible among the group, also wearing a light-colored headscarf or bandana that covers their face. This confirms that both armed adults and a child use similar concealment items."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 88 shows a man at a podium with a blue background featuring the United Nations logo, identified as the UN Secretary-General's spokesperson, indicating the UN reappears later. Logic holds because both slices explicitly reference the United Nations through visuals and identification.",

In Video 2 (0:02-0:04), a split-screen shows three images, with the middle one featuring stacks of money in a case labeled '103zonbi'.

Step 3: Slice 19 shows a money-related shot with the text \"103zombi\" displayed above it, which aligns with the earlier group label (variant spelling). Logic holds because the group name appears on a vehicle and then again on a money tag, with intervening imagery of masked people with weapons reinforcing the identity; the slight label variation is consistent within the context.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a vehicle with '103ZONBI' on the back, while masked individuals chant 'We are the 103 zombies!'. Clip 2 shows these same masked individuals holding weapons. Clip 3 displays social media-style images tagged '103zonbi', including one with large sums of cash. The consistent use of the name '103zombi' across the vehicle, the chants, and the money tag visually reinforces this specific group identity."
