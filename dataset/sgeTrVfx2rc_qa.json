Step 2: Slice 11 states that during the battle footage a QR code is displayed on the right. Logic holds because the question asks for the modern promotional element that appears on both the title screen and later battle footage, and both slices explicitly mention a QR code in those contexts.",

In Video 2, the same QR code remains fixed in the top-left corner throughout the battle footage, confirming its presence on both the title screen and during gameplay."
