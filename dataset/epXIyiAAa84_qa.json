        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 1 explicitly shows a person interacting with a Ouija board, described as a tool associated with communication with the dead, supporting the 'supernatural contact' object. Step 2: Evidence Slice 45 states that a woman (Frances) is in a hallway holding a hammer, looking cautious and alert, matching the description of a woman holding a weapon while cautiously moving through a hallway. Logic holds because Slice 1 covers the early supernatural element and Slice 45 covers the later hallway scene with the hammer.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:07, hands are clearly shown moving a planchette on a Ouija board. In Clip 2, from 0:00 to 0:04 and again at 0:07, a woman named Frances is visibly holding a hammer while standing in a dimly lit hallway, looking cautious."

Step 2: Slice 20 explicitly describes a hand holding a flashlight illuminating a dark room, revealing a green glowing object, which supports the idea of shining light into a dark space to find something unusual. Logic holds because both elements are directly described in the captions.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a hand holds a bottle with a clear label reading 'DIETHYL ETHER'. In Clip 2, a person shines a bright beam of light from a handheld device (flashlight) into a dark space, illuminating a door and later a green-lit object on the floor."

Both items and their contexts align with the question.",

Step 2: Slice 38 presents a newspaper headline reading 'Family of Four Found Dead' dated April 23, 1985, indicating a tragic event.

The narrative continuity and the 'STORY RECAPPED' context indicate this is the same Frances from the investigative clue. Thus, the missing person is Frances Nichols, and she later carries a hammer as if defending herself.",

Step 3: Slice 51 depicts an intense, serious conversation between two women, with one in a light-colored top, and the tone is tense, supporting 'tense, serious confrontation.' Despite minor appearance description differences (likely VLM noise), the emotional progression is directly supported by the slices.",
