Step 2: Slice 72 reports a forum message reading 'Seychelles anon?' indicating discussion tied to Seychelles. Logic holds because the same country name appears explicitly in both the globe segment and the later forum discussion.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually confirms the location as 'Seychelles' during a globe zoom-in sequence (0:02-0:04). Later in Clip 1 (0:16), a forum post is shown with the text 'There was a Seychelles anon posting at least a month ago.' Clip 2 reinforces this by showing another forum post asking 'S-Seychelles anon?' (0:00-0:05), directly linking the persona to the country. The visual evidence across both clips explicitly ties the country 'Seychelles' to both the geographic segment and the forum discussion."

Step 2: Slice 66 shows a man in front of a green screen with a bold yellow overlay reading '15,000 POST IN 24H,' explicitly emphasizing posts within 24 hours. Logic holds because the question asks for the larger milestone in the digital montage (30,000 POST) and the earlier segment emphasizing 24 hours (15,000 POST IN 24H), both directly supported by the slices.",

You will still be subject to various post timers...'. This confirms the stated cooldown and that the Pass doesn't remove all time limits."
