Conclusion: The bandana/leather look (and the ROAD CAPTAIN patch) tracks the same biker figure across the bar scenes.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 7 describes a biker-type character in a bar talking with a suited man, identified by a bandana, full beard, and a leather jacket with a patch reading 'ROAD CAPTAIN.' Step 2: Slice 8 shows a man in a similar bar setting wearing a black leather jacket, a bandana, and having a long beard, indicating the same biker-type character appearing again. Logic holds because the visual attributes match and the setting is consistent across slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In both clips, the biker character consistently wears a patterned bandana, has a full beard, and dons a black leather jacket. In Clip 1 (0:00-0:04), a patch reading 'ROA CPT' (likely 'ROAD CAPTAIN') is visible on his jacket. In Clip 2 (0:01-0:02), he is shown in a wider bar scene with other patrons, still wearing the same attire, confirming his presence in a similar bar environment."

Step 3: Slice 96 explicitly identifies a chest tattoo that says \"BIG STAN.\" Step 4: The proposed answer correctly identifies the name on the chest tattoo (Slice 96) and connects it to the broader prison-group imagery by noting tattoos are shown alongside scenes of inmate groups (Slices 29 and 90). The logic holds without requiring unsupported assumptions.",

Step 2: Slice 45 shows (likely the same) older man in a similar warm, indoor setting wearing a blue checkered shirt, holding a glass of amber-colored liquid, described as likely whiskey or brandy. Logic holds because both slices feature an older man in similar attire and ambiance, making it reasonable they are the same person in nearby scenes.",
