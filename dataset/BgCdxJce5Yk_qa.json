        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 6 (fitness-themed interview with nunchaku image) explicitly states there is 'a small potted plant on a side table between the two chairs.' Step 2: Slice 25 (Deadpool 2 promotional interview) explicitly states 'A small potted plant sits on a side table between them.' Logic holds because both slices describe the same decorative item—a small potted plant—positioned between the two chairs in both interview settings.",
        "visual_proof": "In both Video 1 (0:11-0:22) and Video 2 (0:11-0:14), a small, light-colored vase holding green foliage is clearly visible on the wooden table positioned between the two interview chairs. The item remains in the same location across both distinct interview segments."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 23 states the guests are seated in front of a large screen displaying promotional material for 'Deadpool 2,' indicating that segment has the 'Deadpool 2' screen behind them. Step 2: Slice 57 describes a similar interview setup, but the background screen shows a dynamic action fight scene. Logic holds because the proposed answer maps the first segment to the 'Deadpool 2' promo screen and a later segment to the action scene, which aligns with the two distinct slices presented.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 clearly shows a screen with the 'DEADPOOL 2' logo and a promotional image of the actor. Clip 2 shows the same two guests in the same setting, but the screen behind them now displays a black-and-white action shot of a fight scene, indicating a change in the visual content during the interview."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 87 later shows an interview backdrop prominently displaying the title 'Shadow and Bone,' indicating the show promoted near the end. The logic holds because both slices explicitly state the titles visible in their respective segments.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the large screen behind the interviewees clearly displays the title \"DEADPOOL 2\" alongside its logo. In Clip 2, the same screen shows a different promotional image with the title \"SHADOW AND BONE\" in a distinct font."

Step 2: Slice 24 describes a large screen with promotional material for 'Deadpool 2,' including a character and the Deadpool logo, confirming the Deadpool promo art. Step 3: Slice 38 describes a large screen showing a man in 19th-century attire (black coat, white cravat), confirming a historical/period character. The proposed answer directly matches these three screen subjects without adding unsupported details.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a black-and-white image of Bruce Lee holding nunchucks. Clip 2 displays a screen with 'DEADPOOL 2' text and the Deadpool logo. Clip 3 features a man in period attire, specifically a black coat and white cravat, consistent with a historical character."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 10 shows two people in an interview setting with a large screen displaying a black-and-white image of a muscular man lifting a barbell, suggesting the discussion is about fitness/bodybuilding. Step 2: Slice 23 shows the same setup with the screen displaying promotional material for 'Deadpool 2,' indicating the topic has shifted to that movie. Step 3: Slice 63 shows the screen displaying a dramatic scene with injured people, and it explicitly notes the conversation seems to revolve around the content shown. The people’s attire and setup are consistent across slices, indicating the same show segment. Logic holds because the screen content changes in tandem with the topics discussed, demonstrating it is used as a rotating visual reference to match the discussion.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a black-and-white image of a man with nunchucks, which relates to fitness/martial arts. Clip 2 displays the 'Deadpool 2' movie logo and a promotional photo, clearly indicating a movie promo. Clip 3 features a scene from a film or TV show with two people on the floor in a dramatic pose, fitting the description of a dramatic scene.

Step 2: Evidence Slice 87 explicitly shows a promotional backdrop for 'Shadow and Bone'. Step 3: The slice numbering indicates sequence within the video; 87 is later than 29, so 'Shadow and Bone' appears later than 'Deadpool 2'. Therefore, the context supports both the properties listed and which one appears later.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 clearly displays a promotional backdrop for 'DEADPOOL 2' with its logo and imagery. Clip 2, which is a separate time-slice from the same continuous video, shows a different promotional backdrop for 'SHADOW AND BONE'. Since these are presented as sequential clips from the same source, the change in backdrop confirms that 'Shadow and Bone' is promoted after 'Deadpool 2'."
