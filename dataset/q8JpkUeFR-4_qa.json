Step 2: Slice 15 later shows a man in an orange hoodie in what appears to be the same cozy bedroom (green bedding, framed artwork). It explicitly states there is a decorative pillow that reads 'ADVENTURE AWAITS.' Logic holds because the later scene in the same room includes this clearly named decor item.",
        "visual_proof": "In the first clip (0:12), a man throws a green blanket over another man on the bed. In the second clip (0:04-0:06), the same man, now wearing an orange hoodie, is sitting cross-legged on the bed. Behind him, clearly visible against the white pillows, is a grey decorative pillow with the text 'ADVENTURE AWAITS' written in white script."

Step 2: Slice 63 shows on-screen text stating \"+SKIN CARE ROUTINE LIKE THE MORNING,\" explicitly referencing a skincare routine. Logic holds because the earlier clip demonstrates a skincare routine action, which aligns with the later textual reference to a skincare routine like the morning, making the SPF application an example of the routine mentioned.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually shows the man applying sunscreen (SPF 50) as part of his grooming in the bathroom. Clip 2 features the same man in a different location (locker room) with on-screen text explicitly stating '+SKIN CARE ROUTINE LIKE THE MORNING'. The connection is established by showing the same person performing a skincare step (sunscreen) and then verbally/visually referencing that this is part of a routine similar to his morning one."
