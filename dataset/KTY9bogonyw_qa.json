    "question": "When the show turns from talking about stocks being steady to focusing on AI use cases, what headline is shown for the stocks segment and what AI-related headline replaces it later?",

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 8 explicitly states the lower third shows the headline 'STOCKS STEADY AMID INFLATION WATCH' during the stocks discussion. Step 2: Slice 14 describes a later close-up where the caption reads 'DUDLEY: SURPRISED BY NUMBER OF AI USE CASES,' indicating a shift to AI use cases. Logic holds because the context clearly shows the initial stocks headline and the subsequent AI-related headline.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the lower-third graphic clearly displays 'STOCKS STEADY AMID INFLATION WATCH' while the female host is speaking. In Clip 2, after the scene cuts to the male guest (Dudley), the lower-third graphic changes to 'DUDLEY: SURPRISED BY NUMBER OF AI USE CASES', confirming the transition in topic and headline as described."

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 50 explicitly shows the text overlay 'BP 4Q PROFIT EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS,' confirming BP as the company with fourth-quarter profit exceeding expectations. Step 2: Slice 60 shows the on-screen text 'BOEING, AIRBUS TO POST 1Q DELIVERIES,' confirming that the later deliveries segment discusses Boeing and Airbus. Logic holds because the broadcast transitions from BP profits to Boeing/Airbus deliveries as described.",

Step 3: Slice 60 displays the headline 'BOEING, AIRBUS TO POST 1Q DELIVERIES,' indicating a later segment focused on aviation. The logic is consistent: energy profits → oil price forecast → aviation coverage. All elements of the proposed answer are directly supported by the slices.",

It also mentions discussion topics including 'STOCKS STEADY AMID INFLATION WATCH.' Step 2: Slice 43 reinforces the same purple 'Truist Wealth' branded background and shows live market data, confirming the visual cue and context of a single-guest segment. Step 3: Slice 44 shows a multi-person split-screen panel discussing 'STOCKS STEADY AMID INFLATION WATCH' with an S&P Futures ticker, broadening the context from a solo segment to a panel discussion. The attire of the center participant (gray suit, pocket square) aligns with earlier descriptions, supporting continuity. Thus, the visual cue and broadened context are explicitly supported.",
