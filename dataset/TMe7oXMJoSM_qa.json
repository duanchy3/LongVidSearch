Step 2: Evidence Slice 27 notes that later in the performance the projection changes to display the words 'asko or glasgow,' explicitly described as suggesting a transition in the narrative. Logic holds because the first identifies the initial instrument focus, and the second provides the exact projected phrase signaling a shift.",
