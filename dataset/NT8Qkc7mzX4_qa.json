        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 7 describes the presentation using an optical illusion (the Marilyn–Einstein example) to demonstrate that face recognition depends on context and prior perception, including pareidolia and the influence of social/contextual cues. Step 2: Slice 11 shows the subsequent slide with family photos and bullet points asking 'Who?', 'How old? How tall? What are they doing?', and explicitly stating 'Need to exploit context (or prior)', indicating a shift to analyzing people in images using contextual information.

Clip 2 immediately follows with a slide titled 'Understanding images of people', showing two family photos and listing questions like 'Who?' and 'What are they doing?'.
