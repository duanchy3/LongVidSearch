        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 14 states the video shows a portrait titled 'Betty' (1977) by Gerhard Richter, depicting a young girl in a red sweater. Step 2: Slice 45 shows a close-up of the painting titled 'Betty' (1977) by Gerhard Richter, again depicting a young girl in a red garment. Logic holds because both slices explicitly name the same artwork and describe the same subject (girl in red), indicating it appears early and later as a close-up.",
        "visual_proof": "Both clips display the same artwork, identified by the on-screen text 'Gerhard Richter, Betty, 1977'. Clip 1 shows a blurry, full-face portrait of a girl in a red sweater. Clip 2 shows a clearer, close-up, tilted view of the same girl's face, confirming it is the same portrait shown at different moments in the video."

Step 2: Slice 56 describes a small barrier consisting of a thin rope stretched between two small poles to prevent visitors from getting too close. Logic holds because both slices describe rope-and-stanchion barriers serving the same protective function in front of the artworks.",

Step 3: Among these, only 'The Richter Family 1' and 'The Richter Family 2' correspond to a posed family portrait in a domestic interior, aligning with the later scenes in Slices 39 and 43.
