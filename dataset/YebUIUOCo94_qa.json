Conclusion: The baton’s dual war/peace motto is echoed by later ceremonial weapon display.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 1 explicitly states that the close-up of the ceremonial baton/scepter shows the Latin phrases 'Terror Belli' and 'Decus Pacis.' Step 2: Evidence Slice 5 describes a later scene featuring a close-up of an ornate ceremonial sword resting on a black surface, which aligns with the answer's 'ornate ceremonial sword shown on a black background' and reinforces the theme of military honor and display. Logic holds because the first part identifies the phrases on the baton, and the second part identifies a later artifact consistent with the thematic description.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (0:06-0:19), the ceremonial baton clearly displays the Latin phrases 'Terror Belli' and 'Decus Pacis,' which are also translated as 'Terror in War' and 'Ornament in Peace.' In Clip 2 (0:23-0:31), an ornate ceremonial sword with a detailed hilt and scabbard is shown lying on a black velvet surface, serving as a later artifact that reinforces the theme of military honor and display."

Step 2: Slice 35 describes a vivid painted battlefield scene of the Battle of Austerlitz featuring a central military leader mounted on a white horse.

Step 2: Evidence Slice 74 explicitly identifies the central figure as Napoleon Bonaparte, mounted on a white horse and raising his hat in a military painting. Logic holds because both slices depict the same leader on a white horse with consistent Napoleonic attributes, and Slice 74 confirms the identity explicitly.",

Clip 2 shows the same figure, again on a white horse, now raising his hat in a triumphant gesture, surrounded by troops. The consistent iconography (white horse, bicorne, central positioning) across both paintings strongly identifies the figure as Napoleon Bonaparte."

Step 2: Slice 24 describes an open book with a page titled 'Jean Lannes' containing biography information, and an adjacent page with a map of France, indicating he is later shown in a book spread featuring his biography and a map. Logic holds because 'Jean Lannes' is the same figure as Marshal Lannes, and the visuals directly match the answer’s description.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with the title '2. Marshal Lannes' above his portrait, followed by Napoleon's quote: 'He had truly become a superior being... I found him a pygmy, but I lost a giant.' Clip 2 then shows an open book page with 'JEAN LANNES (1769 - 1809)' and his biography on the left, and a map of France highlighting Gascony on the right, confirming the same individual is featured across both clips."

Step 3: Therefore, the marshal who appears both in the side-by-side comparison with Soult and in earlier biography pages is Jean Lannes. The mention of humble origins is implied by the biography context, but the key conditions (side-by-side with Soult and earlier biography pages) are explicitly supported.",

Step 2: Slice 70 details later biographical frames about Louis Nicolas Davout, including timelines of his career (education, promotions, battles) and his titles (Duke of Auerstedt, Prince of Eckmühl), matching the request for expanded pages with timelines and titles.
