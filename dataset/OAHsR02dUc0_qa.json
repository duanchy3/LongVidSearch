        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 18 describes a blue slide with the word 'Classification' centered, serving as a section title. Step 2: Slice 19 describes the next slide that contrasts two probabilistic worlds (World P and World Q) about images and labels. Logic holds because the question asks which topic is introduced on the blue slide and then followed by the probabilistic worlds slide; Slice 18 explicitly shows 'Classification' and Slice 19 follows with the described contrast.",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip shows a blue slide with the word 'Classification' centered in white text. The second clip immediately follows, showing a slide titled 'World P' and 'World Q', which contrasts two probabilistic models for images and labels. This sequence directly matches the description in the question."

Step 2: Slice 60 shows a standalone blue title card with the word \"Prediction\" centered. Logic holds because the topic \"Prediction\" appears early as a bullet point in the outline and later reappears as a standalone blue title, matching the question’s description.",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip shows a slide titled 'Outline' where 'Prediction' is listed as the last sub-point under 'Universal Recipe'. The second clip displays a full-screen blue title card with the word 'Prediction' in white text, confirming it is a standalone section title later in the video."

Step 2: Slice 33 shows an equation slide titled 'Variational Information Bottleneck' with key terms labeled 'Classification Error' and 'Rate.' Logic holds because both slices reference the same titled topic, first as a blue title card and later as an equation slide with those labels.",

The second clip displays a slide titled 'Variational Information Bottleneck' which presents an equation.

Step 2: Evidence Slice 28 shows a later part of the same presentation discussing 'Fixing A Broken ELBO' with a rate–distortion scatter plot. Logic: The question asks which section title appears on the blue slide and later connects to the rate–distortion/broken ELBO discussion; the blue slide title is 'Variational Autoencoders,' which frames the subsequent ELBO content.",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip shows a blue slide with the title 'Variational Autoencoders'. The second clip, which appears later in the same video (as per context), displays a scatter plot analyzing rate vs. distortion and discusses 'Fixing A Broken ELBO', a concept central to Variational Autoencoders. This establishes a direct visual and thematic connection between the blue slide title and the subsequent content."

Step 2: Slice 22 shows a title card 'Variational Autoencoders'. Step 3: Slice 30 shows a title card 'Variational Information Bottleneck'. Logic: These later title cards match subtopics under the 'Universal Recipe' bullet group from the earlier outline, indicating that 'Universal Recipe' becomes a sequence of section title cards for at least these two subtopics.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays an 'Outline' slide where 'Universal Recipe' is a main bullet point with several sub-bullets, including 'Variational Autoencoders' and 'Variational Information Bottleneck'. Clip 2 and Clip 3 are title cards that visually correspond to these two specific sub-bullets from the 'Universal Recipe' section. This confirms that the 'Universal Recipe' group is the one that later becomes a sequence of section title cards."
