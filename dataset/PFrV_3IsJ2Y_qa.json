        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 4 describes an early serene forest scene where a deer appears briefly, indicating a peaceful animal presence. Step 2: Slice 8 shows two individuals walking through the woods when a large, furry creature suddenly attacks one of them. Logic holds because the question asks for the peaceful animal earlier (deer) and the attacking creature later (large furry creature), which aligns with the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a deer is shown calmly grazing in the forest at 0:00-0:01. In Clip 2, at 0:13-0:17, a large, furry, brown creature is seen suspended in mid-air, seemingly attacking or being thrown, as two people with rifles react in shock while walking through the woods."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 24 describes a kitchen crime scene where someone wearing a 'Forensics' jacket is examining the area, indicating forensic investigators are present. Logic holds because the restraint is clearly identified as handcuffs and the official role at the kitchen scene is forensic investigation.",

Step 2: Slice 46 describes a later close-up of a hand holding a small object, possibly a piece of chalk or similar, with motion suggesting drawing/writing, and ties this to a nighttime porch setting. Logic holds because the early sharp instrument is clearly a needle, and the later writing-like object is described as chalk-like in the porch sequence.",

In the second clip (0:00-0:01), a hand picks up a small, dark, irregularly shaped object from a surface; it is not chalk-like, which is typically white or brightly colored, but rather resembles a piece of charcoal or a similar dark marking tool."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 10 explicitly shows a piece of paper with the word 'obey' and repeats this shot, confirming the repeated command word is 'obey.' Step 2: Slice 73 mentions a wall with graffiti-like markings within a dark, tense sequence, and later specifies the environment as possibly a cave or enclosed space, i.e., a confined, scary setting. Logic holds because the answer identifies 'obey' and locates the markings on a wall in a dark confined space consistent with the described scene.",

In Clip 2, frames 0:05-0:06 show a hand touching a similar dark surface with the word 'PROTECT' written on it. Both instances occur in very dark, confined environments, confirming the location but contradicting the specific word 'obey' from the original answer."

Step 2: Slice 78 describes a fast-paced forest chase where an individual is holding a shotgun, and specifically mentions a close-up of the shotgun highlighting the trigger and grip. Logic holds because both slices explicitly identify the weapon as a shotgun in the respective contexts.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:02, a woman is seen holding a pump-action shotgun inside the dark cabin. In Clip 2, at 0:06, there is a clear close-up of hands operating the bolt action of a rifle, which is visually distinct from the shotgun seen earlier. However, since the original answer states 'a shotgun' for both, it is incorrect for the second part. The weapon in the close-up during the forest chase is a rifle, not a shotgun."

Logic holds because the proposed answer matches these explicit visual details from the slices.",
