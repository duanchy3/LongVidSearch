        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 36 describes a man handling a colorful cat-shaped piñata in a park/playground setting, indicating it's a festive prop. Step 2: Slice 38 describes musicians in traditional Mexican attire performing on a street and identifies them as a mariachi band, which is a live festive cultural performance. Logic holds because the first slice provides the festive object in a park and the second slice provides the festive performance in the street.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a man is seen hitting a brightly colored, striped piñata shaped like a cat in a park setting. In Video 2, a group of musicians dressed in traditional mariachi attire, including violins and guitars, are performing live on a decorated street with festive banners."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 7 describes a woman in a car wearing a blue headscarf and a white shirt. Step 2: Slice 40 describes a woman at a street performance wearing a blue headscarf and a white jacket. Step 3: The consistent identifiers across both scenes are the blue headscarf and a light/white upper garment (shirt in the car, jacket in the street). While the proposed answer specifies an outer layer (jacket/coat), the essential combination—blue headscarf plus light/white top—is supported by both slices, making the identification logically consistent.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the woman in the car is clearly wearing a blue hijab with a white long-sleeved top or jacket. In Video 2, the same woman is seen at the outdoor gathering, identifiable by her identical blue patterned hijab and white outer garment while interacting with the mariachi band."

Conclusion: The video repeatedly uses carried documents/folders (red then yellow) as challenge-related props across scenes.",

Step 2: Slice 9 shows a bearded man in the back seat of a car holding a red book or folder, indicating the red item appears again in a car scene. Step 3: Slice 46 shows another car scene where a yellow folder/book is being held, which continues the paperwork/prop theme. Logic holds because the red book/folder is present in both the pyramid and car contexts, and later a yellow folder appears in the car, sustaining the 'challenge paperwork' motif.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a man holding a red book/folder with 'BEYOND 20' text at the Temple of the Moon. Clip 2 shows a different bearded man in a car holding a red folder/book with 'Ever Been In A Fight?' text.

Step 2: Slice 5 explicitly states that an aerial establishing shot shows the site with the on-screen title 'THE PYRAMID OF TEOTIHUACAN,' identifying it as the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan.

        "visual_proof": "Clip 2, at 0:00-0:01, shows an aerial view of a large pyramid complex with text overlaid that reads 'TEMPLE OF THE MOON'. The visual context and scale are consistent with the archaeological site of Teotihuacan. The preceding clip (Clip 1) shows a couple on top of a similar large pyramid, establishing the location as the same site. The Temple of the Moon is a well-known structure within Teotihuacan, confirming the location."

Step 2: Slice 10 states that a text overlay indicates 'Team White' has noticed 'Team Red' in the traffic, confirming who noticed the other team while stuck in traffic.

Step 3: The consistent clothing and character link the scenes, indicating a progression from the market/taco context to a later sit-down planning moment with papers. The proposed answer reflects this sequence accurately.",

Clip 3 shows the same individuals sitting at a brightly colored, checkered table inside what appears to be a repurposed bus or amusement ride, focused on papers with diagrams, indicating a planning or task-solving activity.

The second setting, shown at 0:04, features two men engaged in what appears to be martial arts sparring or kickboxing on an open dirt ground, not a boxing ring, with no gloves or standard boxing equipment visible."
