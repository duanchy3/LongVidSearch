Step 2: Slice 36 describes a text panel titled 'SCIENCE FICTION' that details an art collaboration involving Kasper König, Genzken, and Wolfgang Tillmans at Museum Ludwig in Cologne. Logic holds because the curator identified in Slice 6 (Kasper König) is the same person referenced in the collaboration described by the later text panel in Slice 36.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a man identified by on-screen text as 'KASPER KÖNIG, CURATOR' is shown speaking in an office setting with a large bookshelf directly behind him. In Clip 2, a red text panel appears with the title 'SCIENCE FICTION' followed by text stating '2001 Kasper König invites Genzken and Wolfgang Tillmans to collaborate... at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany.' This visually confirms both parts of the answer."

Step 2: Slice 20 presents a historical courtyard scene featuring a large, open-framed reflective structure resembling a mirror that reflects a classical building with columns. Logic holds because the later reflective, open-framed structure visually echoes the window theme introduced earlier, and the proposed answer matches these details.",

Despite the text variation, the distinctive clothing (pink T-shirt with bold lettering) and setting link the appearances. Logic holds because the unique pink shirt with prominent text and the studio environment consistently match, and minor text discrepancies can be attributed to caption noise.",

Logic holds because the answer names Michel Würthle for the first part, and the described street-at-night segment in Slice 30 matches the second part’s ambiance. While Slice 30 notes this shot occurs at the end of that video description, it nonetheless provides the exact nightlife scene referenced; the question’s identification of that segment is supported by the content.",
