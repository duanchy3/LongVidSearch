    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 4 states that the scene transitions to a globe with the words 'POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY' written above it, explicitly supporting the first title above a globe. Step 2: Evidence Slice 10 describes a later transition to an animated tropical island setting with the words 'PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY' prominently displayed, explicitly supporting the second title over animated islands. Logic holds because the question references an early globe segment and a later tropical animation, which directly match these two slices.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:11, the text 'POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY' is clearly displayed in green 3D letters over a spinning globe. In Clip 2, at 0:10, the text 'PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY' appears in similar green 3D letters over an animated scene of tropical islands with palm trees."

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 14 explicitly shows a whale shark swimming with a diver and labels it 'Whale sharks,' satisfying the 'fish species shown with a diver.' Step 2: Slice 15 shows a giant clam species with the flag of the Philippines visible, satisfying the 'shellfish shown with a national flag.' Logic holds because each part of the question maps directly to the described visuals in the respective slices.",

Step 2: Evidence Slice 46 describes a map showing where Chavacano, a Spanish-based creole language, is spoken in the Philippines, specifically around Zamboanga City. Logic holds because the question asks for the disputed feature and the creole language highlighted by two different map segments, and both are directly identified in the provided context.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a map of the South China Sea is shown with a red pin and an arrow pointing to 'Scarborough shoal' between the Philippines and China.

Step 2: Slice 29 describes a food collage that includes a dessert labeled 'Peach Mango Pie,' providing the specific dessert name.

Step 2: Slice 8 lists attractions, explicitly including the 'MacArthur Landing Site,' which commemorates his return to the Philippines.

Conclusion: Balikbayan ties to the 10.2 million overseas figure.",

Therefore, the context fully supports the answer.",

Step 2: Evidence Slice 53 explicitly mentions religious holiday labels such as 'ALL SAINTS,' 'HOLY WEEK,' 'CHRISTMAS,' and 'EASTER.'
