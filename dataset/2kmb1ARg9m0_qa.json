Step 2: Slice 73 describes a map of Africa zooming into a location labeled 'Lake Natron' with a white circle, locating the same lake again on a map.

This emphasizes sodium and directly connects it to salt. Step 2: Slice 24 depicts close-ups of salt crystals and salt formations.

Step 3: Slice 16 continues the modern chemical explanation, showing sodium reactions whose products include table salt, explicitly mentioned. Logic holds because the video moves from ancient artifacts to modern chemistry content, and salt appears visually in the shoreline scene and conceptually/visually via written equations naming table salt, bridging the themes.
