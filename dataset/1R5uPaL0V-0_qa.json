        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 11 shows the man filling a pot with water over rice, establishing a pot with rice and water. Step 2: Slice 12 starts with '20 minutes later' and shows the man removing the lid from a large pot and then stirring its contents vigorously. Logic holds because the time-jump implies continuity with the previously prepared pot, and the described actions after the jump match the proposed answer.",

Clip 2, which follows, shows a close-up of hands slicing the same green produce on a cutting board.

Step 2: Slice 24 then shows the next actions in the kitchen: laying out plastic wrap, placing nori, and spreading sushi rice on it, which constitutes the start of assembly.

Step 3: Slices 80 and 86 show 'mukbang time' with the same pink-hoodie participant and the host eating from a large boat-shaped sushi platter.
