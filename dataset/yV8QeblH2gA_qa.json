Step 2: Slice 18 shows a later update on a laptop screen that 'Epidemic Sound & Koji agreed to fund the event.' Logic holds because Slice 16 establishes the earlier urgency, and Slice 18 provides the subsequent funding update; thus the urgency right before the later update is the '10 days left to find a sponsor' message.",

Clip 2 immediately follows this, showing a laptop screen with the text overlay 'Epidemic Sound & Koji agreed to fund the event...!'.
