        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 14 shows a baker in a professional bakery applying frosting and caramel drizzle to cupcakes, clearly indicating cupcake decoration. Step 2: Slice 67 shows anatomy and microbiology textbooks, a brain diagram, and a person studying at a desk, indicating studying from anatomy/science materials. Logic holds because each slice directly depicts the respective activity described in the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a person in a bakery kitchen using a piping bag to apply caramel sauce onto cupcakes with white frosting, clearly depicting the activity of decorating desserts. Clip 2 shows a stack of textbooks including 'Human Anatomy & Physiology' and 'Microbiology,' followed by close-ups of anatomical diagrams (heart, brain) and a person studying at a desk with these books and a laptop, confirming the activity of studying science textbooks."

Step 2: Slice 54 shows a compass graphic with “YouTube Christian Renata,” aligning with the same creator identity. Conclusion: The identifier is “WE ARE TEAM GET LOST,” and the website is www.christian-renata.com.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 41 states the screen shows the text 'WE ARE TEAM GET LOST' and displays the website 'www.christian-renata.com' before transitioning to a couple celebrating on a cliff. Step 2: The proposed answer identifies the on-screen text and the website exactly as presented in Slice 41. Logic holds because the elements cited in the answer are explicitly described in the same slice that features the couple celebrating.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, from 0:00 to 0:03, a couple is visible on a cliff. Overlaid on the scene is the hashtag \"#WEARETEAMGETLOST\" and directly below it, the URL \"www.christian-renata.com\". The text is clearly legible against the bright sky background."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 43 says the bearded man on the beach is carrying a backpack. Step 2: Slice 52 says the bearded man in the airport is wearing a backpack on his shoulders. Logic holds because both slices explicitly state he has a backpack in each scenario, making it the consistent travel-related item.",
        "visual_proof": "In both clips, the bearded man is visibly wearing a gray backpack with shoulder straps. In Clip 1 (beach), the backpack straps are clearly visible over his blue shirt. In Clip 2 (airport terminal), the same backpack is worn and visible from the front as he walks through the hallway."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 4 states there is an underwater shot where a shark is swimming near the surface, which supports the 'animal shown swimming underwater earlier' being a shark. Step 2: Slice 92 describes a man walking toward a group of elephants on land, which supports the 'large animals a man approaches later' being elephants. The sequence and details align logically.",
        "visual_proof": "In the first clip (0:04-0:05), a shark with a distinct dorsal fin and tail is clearly visible swimming underwater near a person. In the second clip (0:07-0:11), a man is seen walking towards and then standing among several large elephants on a dirt path next to a river."
