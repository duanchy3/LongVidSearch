Logic holds because the same exhibition title appears first on the wall and then later on the title card with additional details.",

Step 2: Slice 50 shows two individuals standing by the chasuble and discussing it: a man in a suit and tie and a woman in a brown jacket. Logic holds because the clothing and roles align (man in suit; woman in brown outerwear), and the instructions allow minor naming differences (coat vs. jacket). Therefore, the same pair appears earlier walking and later discussing the exhibit.",
        "visual_proof": "The same man in a grey plaid suit with a blue tie and the same woman in a textured brown coat are seen walking together at the beginning of Clip 1 (0:00-0:02). They reappear later in Clip 1, standing and discussing the exhibits (0:04, 0:06, 0:10, 0:22). The same pair is also shown standing and smiling together in front of a display case in Clip 2 (0:08-0:09), confirming their repeated presence throughout the video."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 1 states the gallery entrance features the inscription 'Tudors: Power and Pageantry' with a focus on 16th-century England. Step 2: Slice 92 shows a title card reading 'The Tudors: Art and Majesty in Renaissance England.' Logic holds because both titles explicitly center on 'The Tudors,' and the geographic/temporal context (16th-century/Renaissance England) is consistent across slices.",

In Clip 2, the formal title card for the exhibition also reads 'the Tudors: Art and Majesty in Renaissance England,' confirming that 'The Tudors' is the consistent historical subject across both titles mentioned in the question."
