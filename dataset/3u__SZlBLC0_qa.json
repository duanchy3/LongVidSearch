The context does not specify the type of bag, and the proposed answer likewise remains general, which is consistent with the provided evidence.",

Step 3: Slice 82 depicts a woman in a black leather jacket approaching a motorcycle and then riding into rural scenery. The consistent attribute (black leather jacket) links the woman across all slices, and Slice 81 adds the curly hair detail. Therefore, the answer identifying her as the woman in the black leather jacket (curly-haired later) is supported.",

In Clip 2, the same woman, identifiable by her curly hair and leather jacket, is shown smiling in a modern waiting area.

Step 3: Slice 55 (and supported by Slice 56) presents a school setting, first an indoor hallway and then the school entrance, where an adult (a woman) and a child wait together, supporting the school hallway/entrance with an adult and child waiting. The sequence of environments aligns with the proposed answer’s progression.",
