        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 5 describes a small yellow single-engine airplane flying over snowy mountains, clearly depicting the airplane in flight. Step 2: Slice 6 shows a title screen reading 'Plane Crash' with the date 'Jan 3, 1982' and a related hospital scene, indicating the crash is being discussed as a dated event. Logic holds because these are two distinct moments covering flight and the dated crash segment, matching the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually shows a small, yellow single-engine airplane flying against a clear sky, which then transitions to it flying over snow-covered mountains with overlaid text. Clip 2 opens with a graphic titled \"Plane Crash\" dated \"JAN 3, 1982,\" directly linking the event to a specific date and confirming the crash narrative discussed in relation to the flight shown earlier."

Step 2: Slice 19 later displays Philip K. Dick's book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and a 'Blade Runner' poster from 1982, linking the author to that film. Logic holds because the sequence first presents the death card and then includes his book along with the 1982 film, tying him to the adaptation.",

Step 3: Slice 71 includes a historical timeline with the explicit reference to 'Time's Man of the Year: A Computer' dated December 26, 1982, which culminates the connection to computing recognition.

Step 3: Slice 41 shows a large fire engulfing what appears to be a vehicle or structure, contributing further vehicle-related disaster imagery. Step 4: Slice 61 depicts a man on a stretcher surrounded by medical personnel, clearly representing emergency response imagery.

Clip 3 depicts a large, fiery explosion on water, consistent with a transport disaster. Clip 4 shows a man being carried on a stretcher by emergency personnel at night, clearly an emergency response scene.

Step 3: Slice 60 shows a historical CNN graphic reading 'Frank Rosenthal Survives Car Bomb' (Oct 4, 1982), which fits the car bomb headline requirement. Step 4: Slice 61 depicts nighttime emergency response footage with an injured man on a stretcher, matching the final element. The sequence logically forms a crime/thriller escalation as described, and each element is directly supported by the respective slices.",
