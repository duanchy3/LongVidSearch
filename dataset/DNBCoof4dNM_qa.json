    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 5 explicitly states the map showcases two international airports: Santo Pekoa International Airport (IATA: SON) and Bauerfield International Airport (IATA: VLI). Step 2: Evidence Slice 45 shows on-screen text reading 'Bislama' with additional text '~90% English vocab Melanesian grammar,' which directly indicates that Bislama is ~90% English vocabulary. The details align and are explicitly supported by the slices.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the map clearly labels 'Santo Pekoa Int. IATA: SON' and 'Bauerfield Int. IATA: VLI'. In Clip 2, a graphic next to the speaker displays the flag of Vanuatu with the text 'Bislama' and below it, '~90% English vocab Melanesian grammar'."

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 16 states the video begins with a title screen introducing the Manaro Voui volcano eruption on Ambae Island (2005). Step 2: Slice 17 describes the same presentation style (man against a black background with inset visuals) and explicitly shows an inset labeled \"Andosol (Volcanic soil)\". Logic holds because the question asks what volcanic soil type is later shown after the eruption introduction, and Slice 17 provides that labeled example.",
    "visual_proof": "The first clip introduces the 'Manaro Voui volcano eruption (Ambae island, 2005)'. The second clip, which follows chronologically in the same video, features a presenter who then displays an image labeled 'Andosol (Volcanic soil)' on the screen to his right. This directly links the volcanic event to the specific soil type shown later."

Step 3: These directly match the proposed answer's two parts.",

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 36 states the man points at a sign that says 'KEEP RIGHT' while a banknote labeled 'Vatu' appears, confirming the driving instruction is 'KEEP RIGHT.' Step 2: Slice 46 explains that the Bislama coach (Christella) introduces and emphasizes the use of 'blong' and contrasts it with 'long' as prepositions/possessives. Logic holds because the first slice directly supports the sign and currency context, and the second slice directly supports the emphasis on 'blong' (and its contrast with 'long').",
    "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a traffic sign clearly displaying the text 'KEEP RIGHT' with an arrow pointing right is shown next to the presenter. In Video 2, the Bislama coach, Christella, explicitly states that 'Blong' is used to indicate possession and contrasts it by stating that 'Long' is used as a preposition, providing examples for both."

Step 2: Slice 24 notes an inset image of the Pokémon 'Dewgong' used in a playful segment, indicating a joke/reference. Logic holds because the marine mammal shown is a dugong, and later the video makes a joke using the similarly named Pokémon 'Dewgong.'",
    "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:11-0:13), a large marine mammal, identified by context as a dugong, is shown swimming and feeding on seagrass. In Video 2 (0:09-0:13), a man discusses this animal, and an image of the Pokémon 'Dewgong' appears on screen with text attributing the joke to 'Barbs,' who calls it 'the most lazy... Named Pokemon ever.' The visual evidence directly links the dugong to the Pokémon 'Dewgong' as a humorous comparison."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 50 describes a flag in the hut scene with the words \"Yaohnanen village Prince Philip cult.\" Logic holds because the first slice identifies the cargo cult example (John Frum) and the second slice clearly states the specific village/associated cult name on the flag.",

Conclusion: The change is jacket off → green hoodie, then black cap; that same outfit is used for the dugong/manatee explanation.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 19 states the man starts in a grey jacket, then takes it off to reveal a green hoodie. Immediately after, a coral reef image appears, and later he puts on a black cap before pointing at a bat image. This supports the sequence: jacket removed (green hoodie revealed) before reefs, and black cap added before bats. Step 2: Slice 23 explicitly shows the man wearing a green hoodie and a black cap while discussing dugongs vs manatees. Step 3: Slice 20 also corroborates that during wildlife discussions he is in a green hoodie and black cap. Logic holds because the clothing changes and topics align across slices.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the presenter starts in a gray button-up jacket over a black shirt. He then appears in a green hoodie and a black cap while discussing Vanuatu's wildlife, including bats. In Clip 3, when discussing dugongs vs. manatees, he is consistently wearing the same green hoodie and black cap."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 4 describes the map zooming in on Vanuatu and then panning to show the country's capital city, Port Vila, which is the capital highlighted on the map segment. Logic holds because both details are directly provided in the slices.",
    "visual_proof": "In the first clip (0:00-0:01), the text 'FIGIME.COM' is clearly displayed in large white letters at the bottom of the screen while the presenter holds a figure. In the second clip (0:20), a map zooms into the island of Efate, and an orange label explicitly points to 'PORT VILA' as its capital city."
