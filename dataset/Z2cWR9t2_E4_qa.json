    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 7 explicitly says a hand pours olive oil into a pan at the beginning, followed by the chopping of an onion, indicating the oil is used before the onion cooking step. Step 2: Slice 52 explicitly shows drizzling olive oil into a frying pan later, with a text overlay confirming 'Olive oil'. Logic holds because both slices directly identify olive oil being poured into the pan at the relevant steps, matching the question's earlier and later stovetop sequences.",
    "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:01-0:04), a clear liquid is poured into a dark pan, and on-screen text explicitly labels it 'Olive oil' and 'Olivenöl'. In Video 2 (0:07-0:10), the same action is repeated with the identical on-screen text 'Olive oil' and 'Olivenöl', confirming the cooking fat used in both stovetop sequences is olive oil."

Conclusion: The dairy ingredient used across these steps is mozzarella (present as slices earlier and as shredded cheese later).",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 23 explicitly shows a hand slicing mozzarella cheese, with on-screen text confirming 'Mozzarella cheese ~ 0.45 lb' and 'Mozzarella-Käse - 200 g'. Step 2: Slice 85 shows shredded cheese being sprinkled over vegetables in the oven, with instructional text. While Slice 85 does not name the cheese type, the question asks which dairy ingredient was sliced earlier and later appears as shredded cheese; the only explicitly named cheese in the earlier step is mozzarella. The logic holds because the identified ingredient from Slice 23 matches the queried item, and the later action involves cheese consistent with the recipe flow.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a block of white cheese is being sliced on a wooden board, with on-screen text identifying it as 'Mozzarella cheese ~ 0.45 lb' and 'Mozzarella-Käse - 200 g'. In Clip 2, shredded white cheese is being sprinkled over a baked vegetable dish in an oven, with on-screen text reading 'Sprinkle with cheese' and 'Mit Käse bestreuen', indicating the same ingredient is used later in the recipe."
