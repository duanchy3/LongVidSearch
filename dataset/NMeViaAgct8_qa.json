        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 11 explicitly states the video begins with a woman in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, establishing the city. Step 2: Slice 11 shows a man with a microphone in a room with a couch and bookshelf; Slice 12 shows the same man in a similar setup with Babbel branding, indicating these slices describe the same promotional video. Step 3: Slice 12 describes a boat ride on the Seine River, which connects to Paris. Logic holds because the landmark footage establishes Paris, and the later river-boat scene is on the Seine, reinforcing the Paris setting within the same promo.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with a clear view of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, establishing the city. Clip 2 features a boat ride along a major river flanked by Parisian architecture and bridges, consistent with the Seine River. The presence of the same 'Babbel' logo throughout both clips confirms they are part of the same promotional segment, linking the iconic landmark to the river experience."

Step 2: Slice 13 shows the man cleaning a kitchen countertop with a cloth while holding a smartphone in his other hand. The Babbel logo appears in both, indicating they are part of the same promotional segment. Logic holds because the activities clearly shift from speaking into a microphone to doing a household chore while using a phone.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the bearded man is seen indoors speaking directly into a large microphone on a boom arm. In Clip 2, the same man is in a kitchen, wiping down a granite countertop with a cloth in one hand while interacting with a smartphone on the counter with his other hand."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 2, Scene 3 explicitly states that a woman in a wide-brimmed hat is aiming a gun at another individual in a daylight alley, confirming the object being brandished is a gun. Step 2: Evidence Slice 88 describes a man in a brick courtyard holding a gun pointed at a kneeling man's head, indicating a similar threat of a gun being aimed. Logic holds because both scenes clearly depict guns being aimed at people, matching the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:07), a woman in a hat is clearly pointing a revolver at a man's head in an alley. In Video 2 (0:00), a close-up shows a pistol being pointed directly at a man's face, and the wider shot at 0:01 confirms this confrontation is happening in a brick courtyard with a vintage car."

Step 2: Slice 21 explicitly places the later scene in an early 20th-century bar or speakeasy, with two men at a table and a bottle of alcohol visible, again in a crowded, tense setting.

The proposed answer states that an office communication involving a call is shown and later a newspaper clipping with a group photo is shown, which matches these descriptions. The answer does not introduce unsupported claims and aligns with the visual evidence.",
