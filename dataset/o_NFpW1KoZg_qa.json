        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 12 shows a close-up of SK Cheng with an on-screen label identifying him as MD & Group CEO of ComfortDelGro, implying he is an upcoming guest. Step 2: Slice 74 describes an exclusive interview segment focused on ComfortDelGro's business strategy and expansion plans, featuring SK Cheng, again identified as Managing Director and Group CEO of ComfortDelGro. Logic holds because the same individual (SK Cheng) is teased and later appears in the exclusive interview, and his company is ComfortDelGro.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (0:06-0:13) features a 'COMING UP' graphic that explicitly teases an exclusive interview with 'SK Cheng, ComfortDelGro MD & Group CEO'. Clip 2 (0:03-0:17) shows SK Cheng being interviewed, with on-screen text identifying him as 'ComfortDelGro Managing Director and Group CEO' and the topic as 'COMFORTDELGRO'S EXPANSION PLANS'. This confirms the same individual and company are featured in both segments."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 29 explicitly shows a news segment labeled 'TRADE & TARIFFS' with text stating 'RENEWAL OF PROHIBITION ON E-COMMERCE TARIFFS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION,' confirming the policy area is trade & tariffs (e-commerce tariffs). Step 2: Slice 32 shows a blue screen reading '13th WTO Ministerial Conference Abu Dhabi UAE 2024' and visuals of a stage, flags, people at microphones, and a large crowd, indicating a formal WTO ministerial conference venue (a conference hall/stage). Logic holds because the first slice sets the policy topic and the second slice shows the related formal ministerial setting.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with a news banner explicitly stating 'RENEWAL OF PROHIBITION ON E-COMMERCE TARIFFS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION' under the 'TRADE & TARIFFS' category. Clip 2 then shows the official logo for the '13th WTO MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE ABU DHABI - UAE 2024', followed by scenes of dignitaries walking onto a large, formal stage and sitting at a long conference table in a large hall filled with delegates, which is characteristic of a ministerial conference venue."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 52 describes a chart titled 'UNITED STATES DOLLAR - JAPANESE YEN' with 'USDJPY' noted, confirming the currency pair charted later is USD/JPY.

Step 2: Slice 11 also features Marc Franklin in a studio with a stylized Ferris wheel graphic in the background during an NYCB-focused segment.

This backdrop is visible in the initial frames of both clips (e.g., 0:00 in Video 1 and 0:00 in Video 2) and remains present throughout the segments, serving as a recurring studio motif for his appearances."
