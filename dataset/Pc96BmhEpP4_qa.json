Step 2: Slice 61 explicitly shows Oleksandr Syrskyi, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in a formal office/interview setting, clearly the 'formal office interview with the commander in uniform' format.

Step 2: Slice 64 describes a man with short dark hair and a mustache, wearing a yellow shirt under a dark blazer, in front of black curtains with a golden stripe, with 'to the point' logo and a lower-third identifying him as Moritz Gathmann.

The mention of the golden stripe in Slice 64 aligns with 'sometimes with a gold stripe' in the answer.",
