        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 1 explicitly identifies Marina Bay Sands, describing three towers connected by a SkyPark, shown in an aerial daylight view of Marina Bay. Step 2: Slice 24 describes a nighttime scene with a prominent structure of three towers connected by a horizontal element behind a man by the water, matching the distinctive features of Marina Bay Sands. Logic holds because the same uniquely described building appears in both slices—daytime aerial view and nighttime illuminated view.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows an aerial view of Singapore's skyline during the day, prominently featuring the Marina Bay Sands hotel with its three towers and rooftop SkyPark. Clip 2 shows the same building at night, fully illuminated, in the background behind a man who is holding up his phone. The unique architecture of the building is clearly identifiable in both clips."

Step 2: Slice 7 further transitions to a busy street scene in Chinatown, Singapore. Step 3: Slices 9 and 12 describe the culturally themed street/market with red lanterns in Singapore, consistent with Chinatown. Therefore, the sequence—ticket machine → subway carriage → Chinatown street/market with lanterns—is directly supported.",

Clip 2 and Clip 3 show the man walking through a street decorated with red lanterns and traditional architecture, identified as Chinatown in Clip 2 by the overhead station sign.

Step 3: Slice 56 reinforces the twilight/night setting with a light show on the Supertrees at Gardens by the Bay.
