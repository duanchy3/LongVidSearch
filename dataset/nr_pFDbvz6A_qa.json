Step 2: Slice 50 shows Napoleon’s quote saying Soult should have been shot and calling him the greatest pillager. Conclusion: Ney is praised for valour; Soult is condemned as a pillager.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 15 displays '5. Marshal Ney' with Napoleon’s quote: 'Ney was priceless for his valour...' confirming Ney is called 'priceless for valour.' Step 2: Slice 50 displays '4. Marshal Soult' with Napoleon’s quote: 'He was the greatest pillager of them all,' confirming Soult is accused of being the 'greatest pillager.' The two slices clearly and explicitly support the proposed mapping.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (Marshal Ney) displays the quote: 'Ney was priceless for his valour...'. Clip 2 (Marshal Soult) displays the quote: 'He was the greatest pillager of them all.' Both quotes are explicitly attributed to Napoleon in the respective clips."

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 46 explicitly shows the Battle of Waterloo map and states that labels appear for key locations including 'La Haye Sainte Farm' and 'Hougoumont Farm,' so the battle map with those labels is the Waterloo map. Step 2: Slice 45 describes a regional map of the Netherlands and Belgium during the Napoleonic Wars, with cities like Brussels, Antwerp, and Charleroi and military symbols, serving as an educational regional overview. This matches the 'nearby segment' that introduces the regional map leading into the Waterloo battle context. Logic holds because Slice 46 provides the labeled battle map, and Slice 45 is the regional map segment immediately relevant to that battle.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays a regional map labeled 'NETHERLANDS' and 'FRANCE', showing troop movements converging on locations like Charleroi, leading to the battles at Quatre-Bras and Ligny on June 16th, 1815. Clip 2 then shows a detailed battlefield map with explicit labels for key strongpoints such as 'Hougoumont Farm', 'La Haye Sainte Farm', and 'Papelotte Farm', which are iconic features of the Battle of Waterloo. The sequence of clips confirms that the regional map (Clip 1) precedes the detailed battle map (Clip 2)."

Step 2: Slice 57 explicitly states the video shows an animated map illustrating the Battle of La Coruña on January 16, 1809.

In Clip 2, a biographical page for 'MICHEL NEY' displays a quote attributed to Napoleon: 'What a soldier! The army is full of brave men, but Michel Ney is truly the bravest of the brave.'
