Step 2: Evidence Slice 5 shows an aerial view of the \"Oceanic Institute Hainan, China\" and references the \"Wanming Whale Spirit Research Institute,\" indicating the institute is located in Hainan, China.

Step 2: Slice 9 describes a later title/diagram screen featuring the words 'THERMOCLINE' and 'TRENCH' with graphical elements (red circle and arrows), highlighting 'TRENCH' as a depth feature. Logic holds because the first term (thermocline) is emphasized during the submersible presentation, and the later screen highlights the related depth feature term (trench).",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a diagram screen with the word 'THERMOCLINE' clearly displayed in large, glowing letters. Clip 2 shows a subsequent diagram screen with the word 'TRENCH' displayed in the same style, directly below the thermocline layer, visually linking the two terms as requested in the question."
