Conclusion: The process flows from prep/painting to tape removal finish.",

Step 2: Slice 23 shows painting sections of a wall with blue paint and using painter’s tape to create clean edges around a light switch. Step 3: Slice 27 shows peeling blue painter’s tape off various surfaces (including walls and around a light switch), revealing clean edges. Logic holds because the sequence of preparation/rolling, painting (including blue), and later tape removal to reveal clean lines is explicitly depicted across the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows paint being prepared (stirred and poured into a tray) and applied with a roller. Clip 2 shows a person painting a wall section with blue paint using a brush. Clip 3 shows the removal of blue painter's tape from various surfaces (wall, door frame, outlet) to reveal crisp, clean painted edges. This sequence directly matches the described process."
