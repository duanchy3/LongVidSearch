Step 2: Slice 20 explicitly shows the striped-shirt person sprinkling salt with the on-screen instruction to whisk until fully combined with no streaks. Conclusion: The ingredient added at that step is salt.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 20 explicitly shows the striped-shirt person holding a small jar of salt and sprinkling it into the bowl. Step 2: In the same slice, the on-screen text reads: \"Add a pinch of salt and whisk until the whites and yolks are completely combined with no streaks of egg whites remaining,\" directly tying the added ingredient to the instruction about whisking. Step 3: This matches the question’s timing and subject (striped-shirt man, egg mixture, instruction about no streaks). Therefore, the ingredient is salt.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 2, at timestamp 0:04, the man in the striped shirt is shown adding a white granular substance from a small container into the bowl of eggs. Immediately following this action, at 0:05, an on-screen text overlay appears which reads: '2. Add a pinch of salt and whisk until the whites and the yolks are completely combined with no streaks of egg whites remaining.' This sequence visually confirms that he added salt right before the instruction to whisk appeared."

Step 2: Slice 42 states that a man wearing a striped shirt later holds a fine mesh strainer and explains straining the egg mixture. Logic holds because both slices consistently identify the person by the striped shirt and the actions are sequential within the same cooking tutorial, indicating it is the same individual.",
