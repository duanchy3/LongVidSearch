Step 2: Slice 76 describes an office/business consultation with documents spread out on the desk; the woman gestures to and discusses these documents while the man listens and nods.

The yellow-shirted man picks up an apple and hands it to the other man, who then puts it back. This supports the part about handing an apple during a friendly greeting in a produce-stocked kitchen. Step 2: Slice 23 describes the same yellow-shirted man and another man (described here as wearing blue/khaki, likely the same person per VLM naming variance) near a cardboard box of groceries; the yellow-shirted man appears to be unpacking/organizing, and the other man follows and embraces him warmly. This supports the part about a later embrace in the context of moving toward and unpacking a grocery box. Logic holds because the actions (apple handoff, later hug during grocery unpacking) align across slices despite minor clothing description differences.",
