        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 12 explicitly states a painting titled 'Dead Rabbit With a Copper Pot' is by Georgia O'Keeffe (1907), establishing the early still-life of a dead rabbit by her. Step 2: Slice 26 explicitly states visitors are viewing 'Jimson Weed/White Flower' by Georgia O'Keeffe (1932), the large white flower painting. Logic holds because both slices name Georgia O'Keeffe as the artist for the respective works, tying her to both contexts.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays the painting 'Dead Rabbit With a Copper Pot' with an on-screen caption identifying the artist as 'Georgia O'Keeffe, 1907'. Clip 2 shows the painting 'Jimson Weed/White Flower' with a caption identifying the artist as 'Georgia O'Keeffe, 1932', while gallery visitors observe it. Both captions explicitly attribute the artworks to Georgia O'Keeffe."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 1 explicitly states that a logo with the word \"WONDRIUM\" appears on a deep blue background with a large yellow W. Step 2: Slice 91 shows a white screen with a large yellow W and the word \"WONDRUM\" beneath it, followed by a web-style content grid of educational categories. Step 3: The naming discrepancy (WONDRIUM vs. WONDRUM) can be treated as VLM noise, as the visual attributes (large yellow W logo and educational platform interface) align. Step 4: The question asks for the platform name that appears first as a logo and later as a web content grid; Slice 1 directly names it as Wondrium, and Slice 91's interface corroborates this contextually.",
