        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 2 states that the text 'STORY RECAPPED' appears on the screen, which supports the watermark indicating the video is a recap. Step 2: Evidence Slice 99 describes the end screen with 'THANKS FOR WATCHING' and 'SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE', clearly supporting the ending message. Logic holds because both parts of the proposed answer directly match the explicit text from the provided slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 clearly shows the text 'STORY RECAPPED' as a watermark in the bottom right corner across multiple frames. Clip 2 displays an end screen with the text 'THANKS FOR WATCHING' at the top and 'SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE' below it, confirming the final message of the video."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 14 explicitly quotes the handwritten note: \"Glenn, I am leaving the ship, effective immediately...\" confirming the content about leaving. Step 2: Slice 66 states that a sign in the background reads \"Federation of Star Command\" and \"Starship One\" while a man reads a document. Logic holds because the question asks for the note's leaving statement and the organization name behind the man later, both of which are directly provided in the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a close-up of the handwritten note clearly shows the text: 'I am leaving the ship, effective immediately.' In Clip 2, a wall sign is visible behind the man reading the paper, which reads 'FEDERATION OF STAR COMMAND' and 'STARSHIP ONE'."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 25 states the man reaches out to a vintage-style radio and interacts with it, possibly tuning or adjusting the volume, which supports 'adjusts/uses a vintage radio.' Step 2: Slice 24 describes the earlier bathtub scene as bubble-filled and notes the man is blindfolded, with the mood described as calm and indulgent. Logic holds because the old audio device is the vintage radio he adjusts, and the bubble-filled tub with a blindfold is the indulgent detail from the earlier scene.",

Conclusion: Distress is shown in both outdoor and indoor scenes.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 40 describes an outdoor scene with lush greenery where a young girl with long blonde hair and glasses looks concerned or worried while interacting with another woman. This supports the first moment of the girl in distress outdoors. Step 2: Slice 43 shows an indoor living room setting where a young girl with blonde hair and glasses is sitting on a couch, looking concerned, while an adult woman speaks earnestly and seriously. This supports the second moment of the girl distressed on a couch indoors. Logic holds because both slices depict the same type of character (young girl with glasses) in two distinct settings reflecting distress.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows the girl with glasses outdoors at night, with dark foliage in the background, looking distressed during a conversation. Clip 2 shows the same girl, now indoors, sitting on a couch in overalls, looking downcast and upset while an adult woman beside her speaks to her."
