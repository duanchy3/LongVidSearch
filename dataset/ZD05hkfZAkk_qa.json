        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 11 explicitly shows an old upright piano in a workshop/storage setting, establishing the prop in a workroom context. Step 2: Slice 23’s final scene describes a close-up of a hand playing a piano, indicating the same prop reappears as a close-up in another montage segment. Logic holds because both slices reference a piano, first in a workroom and later in a close-up.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a dusty upright piano is prominently featured in a cluttered workroom setting at 0:00. Later, at 0:03, there is a close-up of a man's hand on the piano keys. In Video 2, at 0:14, another close-up of piano keys is shown as part of a different scene, confirming the piano's recurring presence across both segments."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 20 describes a man who suddenly wakes up in a dark bedroom and a glass of milk spills, establishing the first awakening. Step 2: Slice 22 describes a later, similar scene where a man jolts awake and a person, appearing to be a woman, is silhouetted near the door. Logic holds because the question links the initial awakening with the spill to a later similar awakening that includes a silhouetted figure, which Slice 22 explicitly describes.",

        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a man in pajamas is shown waking up abruptly in bed (0:10-0:13), followed by a shot of a glass of milk spilling on the floor (0:19). Later in Clip 2, the same man is seen waking up again with a startled expression (0:05). Immediately following this, at 0:08, a silhouetted figure appears in the doorway. The figure's short hair and build, visible when they enter the room at 0:21-0:23, confirm it is an older man wearing glasses and a dark coat, not a woman."

Step 2: Slice 6 explicitly describes a jewelry store scene where a man closely examines a watch.

In Clip 2 (0:03), the scene shifts to a luxury shop with display cases of jewelry. Later in Clip 2 (0:07), there is a close-up shot of a man's wrist where he is examining or adjusting a metallic watch, confirming the second part of the answer."

Step 2: Slice 83 shows a man in a white suit aiming a gun in a luxurious, upscale interior (hotel/upscale residence).

In Clip 2, the same man in the white suit is shown exiting the damaged car and then aiming a handgun upwards while on a staircase inside a well-appointed building with ornate railings, which fits the description of a luxurious interior."
