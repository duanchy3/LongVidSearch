Step 2: Slice 22 shows a person in a dark jacket operating a handheld angle grinder that is connected via a cable to a red generator placed on a wooden surface. Logic holds because the red power device on a wooden surface with a cable in Slice 19 matches the red generator with a cable on a wooden surface in Slice 22, implying the same setup is used to power the handheld angle grinder.",

In Video 2, the same red device is visible on a stump, and the man is actively using a handheld angle grinder, which is connected to it via the unwound cable. Sparks are seen as he cuts a metal rod with the grinder, confirming its operation from that setup."

Step 3: Slice 62 specifically presents a smartphone ad for a Premium Damascus Chef Knife with a QR code while meat roasts in a traditional stone oven, directly supporting the 'QR-linked promotion near roasting meat.' Logic holds because the video consistently moves from phone-based knife browsing to on-site traditional cooking with a phone ad/QR code visible near roasting meat.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a phone displaying the 'homewild.shop' website with various knives for sale, followed by a person using one of those knives to prepare poultry. Clip 2 continues this theme, showing the same phone interface with an 'ADD TO CART' button for a 'PREMIUM DAMASCUS CHEF KNIFE'.
