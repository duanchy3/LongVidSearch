Step 2: Slice 31 shows three men sitting together in the back seat of a car, indicating they are traveling together.

Step 3: Slice 72 shows a scene in a kitchen with an on-screen label 'Olga Local Shaman,' indicating they meet the local shaman. The sequence logically moves from arrival to the shaman mention in transit to meeting the shaman in a kitchen.",

Step 2: Slice 25 shows the same duo (blue jacket with fur-lined hood and black puffer with fur-lined hood) exploring an underground tunnel with icicles (an icy corridor/cave), with the man in black leading and the blue-jacketed man accompanying.

Step 3: Slice 58 shows indoors they continue with a blue bucket of ice, adding a bag of ice and more ice, which continues the same preparation motif (managing buckets of ice) indoors. The proposed answer aligns with these details, noting outdoor handling of ice and later indoor filling/managing of buckets including adding bagged ice.",

The proposed answer matches these elements: outdoor energetic city walk followed by entry into a wooden cabin and being greeted with smiles, waves, and a handshake. While 'speaking' and 'markets' are not explicitly stated, the core claims (energetic outdoor city walk and indoor hospitality with greetings) are fully supported by the slices.",
