Step 2: Slice 48 shows a man in a green sweater and yellow beanie with a hot drink (white mug) and pastries/cookies on a plate in front of him, indicating the snack is present alongside the drink. Logic holds because the close-up snack is a partially eaten pastry, and the later scene features pastries with a hot drink, aligning with the question's description of the snack being eaten and present with the man's beverage.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a close-up of a partially eaten, fried, dough-like pastry on a grey metal plate. Clip 2 shows the same man in a green sweater and yellow beanie sitting at a table with a white mug (hot drink) and a pastry that matches the one from Clip 1, which he is actively eating. The visual continuity confirms it's the same snack."
