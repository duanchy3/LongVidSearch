        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 50 describes a capitol building with two large bells in front and a sign reading '18 - Mississippi', which supports that Mississippi is shown with two large bells. Step 2: Slice 22 identifies the New Hampshire State House and mentions a large, ornate bell on the grounds, with text '32 - New Hampshire', supporting that New Hampshire is shown with the ornate bell. The logic is consistent across slices.",

This matches the first description. Step 2: Slice 17 shows a scene labeled \"36 Delaware\" with \"a large brick building with a clock tower\" and \"a statue of a man on horseback\" in front, matching the second description. Logic holds because each slice pairs the described statue features with the state text overlays, identifying the locations as North Carolina and Delaware.",

Step 2: Slice 62 explicitly shows the Nebraska State Capitol with a tall central tower, captured during dawn or dusk and illuminated by artificial lighting.

Step 2: Slice 67 describes the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison with a large body of water visible beyond the city, also confirming water near the capitol. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention aerial views of state capitols with nearby bodies of water, matching the proposed states.",

Step 2: Slice 31 again shows the Washington State Capitol and notes flags (American and Washington state) visible near the dome, with the caption '27 - Washington'. Logic holds because both slices clearly and explicitly state the location is Washington, satisfying the question's identification of the state. While the 'overcast autumn-like scene of a green dome' is not described in these slices, the state identification is still directly supported.",

Clip 2 shows the same building on a bright day with visible flags (U.S. and Washington state flag) near the dome. The on-screen text '27 - Washington' in both clips confirms the location."

Step 3: Slice 6 explicitly shows the Florida State Capitol with rows of American flags arranged across the lawn. While Slice 9 mentions North Carolina and Ohio also have flags at half-mast, the proposed answer does not contradict this; it correctly identifies two states with half-mast flags and the additional state with multiple flags on the lawn.",

The other clips (Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio) do not show flags at half-mast or multiple flags on the lawn, confirming the answer."
