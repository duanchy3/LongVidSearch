Step 2: Slice 31 includes the text, “I'm doing these new things to preserve our legacy. I hope it will draw attention to our Niigata butsudan,” linking new creative work to preserving and highlighting Niigata Buddhist altars. Logic holds because the first slice defines the unique feature of the regional altars, and the second slice specifies the heritage (Niigata butsudan) she aims to spotlight.",

In Clip 2, a woman discusses her creative work, and the subtitles state, 'I'm doing these new things to preserve our legacy. I hope it will draw attention to our Niigata butsudan.'
