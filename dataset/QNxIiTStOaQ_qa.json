        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 29 states the eyeliner being applied is labeled 'KVD Beauty Tattoo Pencil Liner,' confirming the brand used in the tutorial. Step 2: Slice 59 states the woman walks past a building with a sign that reads 'KVD Beauty,' confirming the same brand appears on a storefront. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention 'KVD Beauty' in the relevant contexts.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the on-screen text at 0:09 explicitly names 'KVD Beauty Tattoo Pencil Liner' while showing the woman's eyeliner. In Clip 2, at 0:00, the on-screen text states 'and today was the real test with KVD Beauty', confirming the brand again. The storefront she walks past does not visually display the 'KVD Beauty' brand name; however, the question links the product used in the tutorial (visually confirmed via text) to the brand mentioned later in the video, which is also visually confirmed by text."

Step 2: Slice 80 explicitly describes a concert performance by Tomorrow X Together (TXT) at a festival stage, with overlays indicating date and stage, consistent with Lollapalooza. Logic holds because the video context includes Lollapalooza and later shows a TXT set, matching the query about which K-pop group’s performance is shown later. The countdown detail is not necessary to identify the group.",

Step 2: Slice 64 shows a group of people wearing blue rain ponchos outdoors in rainy weather.

In Video 2, immediately following this, a concert stage is shown with red lighting and large screens displaying a performer.

Step 3: Slice 86 shows a ramen mukbang followed by a serene outdoor tree shot with text implying relief after a hot bowl of ramen, matching the 'calm outdoor tree shot implying post-meal relief.' Logic holds because the elevator scene leads to dining at Daifuku Ramen featuring ramen, and is later followed by the calm tree scene tied to the ramen meal.",

Step 2: Slice 9 shows the creator’s festival essentials and explicitly lists a 'Miffy plush toy.' Step 3: Slice 48 shows a plush toy resembling a cartoon rabbit being held while the overlay mentions 'Miffy,' reinforcing that Miffy is associated with a rabbit plush within this video context.

        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (0:02-0:04), a woman in the festival crowd is holding a white plush rabbit with blue overalls.
