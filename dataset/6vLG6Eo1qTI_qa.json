Step 2: Slice 52 describes an urban disaster scene where two parked cars are severely damaged and crushed by falling rubble, likely from an earthquake-like event. Logic holds because these two slices match the two sequences referenced: one of vehicles submerged by flooding and another of vehicles crushed by debris.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows multiple cars partially submerged in floodwater on a highway with city skyscrapers in the background. Clip 2 shows a red Volkswagen with its windshield shattered and covered in bricks and rubble, indicating structural collapse consistent with earthquake damage."

Step 2: Slice 19 explicitly describes a large, dark funnel cloud (tornado) seen from a road perspective, with a visible column connecting to the ground. Logic holds because both slices depict tornadoes directly as funnels, not as statistical maps, matching the proposed descriptions of 'open-landscape tornado funnel' and 'road-view tornado funnel in the distance.'",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a classic, well-defined tornado funnel extending from dark storm clouds to the ground over an open field with silhouetted trees and power lines. Clip 2 shows another prominent tornado funnel descending from a massive supercell cloud base, viewed from a straight highway stretching into the distance, with fields on either side. Both clips depict physical, visual funnels, not statistical maps."

Step 3: Slice 11 depicts an urban storm/flood scene with bent palm trees, flooded roads, and debris, showing similar urban spaces (streets, palms) becoming hazardous.
