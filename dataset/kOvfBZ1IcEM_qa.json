    "question": "In the tech storyline, the same executive appears in a leather jacket presenting hardware; what item does he hold up in the earlier product reveal and what broader system is showcased later on stage?",

Step 2: Slice 77 shows the Blackwell Platform and the headline about system design. Conclusion: Earlier is the Blackwell chip; later is the Blackwell Platform system.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 59 shows a man in a black leather jacket holding a small black square object, with on-screen text \"NVIDIA UNVEILS 'BLACKWELL' CHIP,\" indicating he is holding the Blackwell chip. Step 2: Slice 77 describes Jensen Huang presenting the NVIDIA Blackwell Platform, with visuals of servers, switches, and other hardware, and text emphasizing system design. Logic holds because both slices pertain to NVIDIA presentations, and the earlier item is explicitly the Blackwell chip while the later showcase is the NVIDIA Blackwell Platform.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, Jensen Huang, identifiable by his glasses and leather jacket, holds a small square chip with text on it; the on-screen banner explicitly states 'NVIDIA UNVEILS 'BLACKWELL' CHIP'. In Clip 2, the same individual (identified by the on-screen label as 'Jensen Huang, NVIDIA CEO') stands before a large server rack system labeled 'NVIDIA Blackwell Platform', confirming the broader system being showcased."

Logic holds because the sequence moves from the Germany survey to the mention of the FOMC meeting starting.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 clearly displays a text overlay stating '10AM UK: GERMANY ZEW EXPECTATIONS SURVEY' over scenes of German city life. Clip 2 transitions to show the U.S. Federal Reserve building with a text overlay that reads 'TODAY: FOMC MEETING BEGINS'. The sequence visually confirms the broadcast moves from the Germany survey to the U.S. central bank event."

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 36 states that, according to the Gunvor CEO, drone strikes have shut approximately 600,000 barrels of Russian refining capacity. Step 2: Slice 41 shows a later discussion with two anchors where the on-screen headline reads 'GUNVOR CEO: DRONES SHUT APPROX 600,000 BARRELS OF RUSSIAN REFINING,' repeating the same figure.

Step 2: Slice 68 describes a split-screen live broadcast featuring a BOJ press conference (with Ueda quotes) and notes the USD/JPY displayed around 150.46. Step 3: Therefore, the two quoted levels are ~150.43 in the studio market update and ~150.46 during the press briefing coverage, with the press briefing tied to the ~150.46 figure.",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (0:15-0:22), a graphic shows the USD/JPY rate at 150.39, then rising to 150.43, displayed alongside reporter Stephen Engle discussing the BOJ's decision. In Clip 2 (0:11-0:29), during the split-screen coverage of the BOJ press briefing with Governor Ueda, the on-screen ticker consistently displays the USD/JPY rate as 150.44, 150.45, 150.46, and 150.47, confirming the second quoted level is tied to the live press briefing."
