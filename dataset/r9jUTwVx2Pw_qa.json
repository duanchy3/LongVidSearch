    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 14 states the map of Florida highlights Palmdale in Glades County and zooms in on the Palmdale area. Step 2: Slice 15 states the aerial shot is specifically Palmdale/Glades County, showing a rural community with RVs and a prominent blue-roofed building. Logic holds because the place introduced on the map (Palmdale) is the same place shown in the aerial view with the described features.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a map of Florida with a pin on 'Palmdale' and text identifying 'Florida - Palmdale/Glades County'. Clip 2 provides an aerial view of a rural community with numerous RVs and a large building with a prominent blue roof, which is consistent with the location introduced in Clip 1. The text overlay 'Florida - Palmdale/Glades County' is also present in Clip 2, confirming the location."

    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 45 shows a static map labeled 'Manhattan' in Nevada with a small orange pin and the text 'Nevada - Manhattan.' Step 2: Slice 46 shows a wooden welcome sign reading 'WELCOME MANHATTAN NEVADA' with 'EST. 1905 EL. 7000.' Logic holds because both slices explicitly identify the town as Manhattan, Nevada and match the described visuals (map with orange pin, then welcome sign with establishment year and elevation).",

    "question": "Which location features a directional desert signpost listing Trout Creek, Gold Hill, and Ibapah, and what U.S. state map introduces that location just before the signpost appears?",

Conclusion: The signpost is in Gandy/Callao, introduced by a Utah map.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 72 explicitly states that in Utah near Gandy/Callao there is a directional desert signpost listing Trout Creek (16 miles), Gold Hill (22 miles), and Ibapah (34 miles). Step 2: Slice 71 mentions a transition to a map of Utah highlighting Gandy/Callao. Step 3: The logical sequence is that the Utah map (Slice 71) introduces the Gandy/Callao location, which is then shown with the signpost (Slice 72). Therefore, the location is Gandy/Callao and the introducing state map is Utah.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 2 (0:00-0:07) visually shows the directional desert signpost listing 'TROUT CREEK 16', 'GOLD HILL 22', and 'IBAPAH 36'. The text overlay on this clip identifies the location as 'Utah - Gandy/Callao'. Clip 1 (0:15-0:24) immediately preceding this scene displays a map of Utah with a red pin on 'Gandy' and the same 'Utah - Gandy/Callao' text overlay, confirming the map introduces the location before the signpost appears."
