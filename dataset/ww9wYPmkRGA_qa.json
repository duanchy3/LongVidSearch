Step 2: Slice 60 shows a man adding tomatoes to a large pan with meat and vegetables. Logic holds because both slices explicitly reference tomatoes, first being handled in a basket and later being added to the pan.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a close-up shot clearly shows hands handling bright red tomatoes in a wicker basket. In Video 2, the same type of tomatoes are then poured from a wooden bowl into the large pan containing meat and vegetables, confirming they are the ingredient handled in the basket before being added to the pan."

Step 2: Slice 96 describes the meal-eating scene with a man wearing a green jacket over a purple shirt. Logic holds because the green jacket is present in both scenes, serving as the consistent clothing detail linking the same main cook. The mention of green pants appears only in Slice 27, but the green jacket is the consistent identifier.",
        "visual_proof": "In both clips, the main person is wearing the same olive-green fleece jacket. In Clip 1, he is also seen wearing matching green pants while preparing tea. In Clip 2, he is seated at the table eating, still wearing the identical green jacket over a purple shirt. The consistent outerwear across both distinct activities confirms it is the same individual."

Step 2: Slice 65 states that a white sauce is poured over the dish late in the cooking process; while it does not say 'paella pan,' it matches the same outdoor cooked dish with meat and tomatoes, consistent with Slice 64. Step 3: Slice 70 explicitly shows the final plated dish with yellow rice and meat, and clearly states that chopped basil is sprinkled over it. Step 4: Therefore, the item added late in cooking is the white sauce (Slice 65), and the herb sprinkled later on the plated dish is chopped basil (Slice 70).

In Clip 2 (0:04-0:05), the man is seen sprinkling finely chopped green herbs over the finished dish; these herbs are visually identifiable as parsley due to their leaf shape, not basil. The herb being chopped on the table in Clip 2 (0:00-0:03) also appears to be parsley."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 17 states the person sprinkles salt into a large metal pot with water and raw fish, indicating the fish in the pot is seasoned first with salt. Step 2: Slice 56 shows a man sprinkling salt onto a large pan filled with yellow vegetables during an outdoor cook where meat is later added, so the yellow vegetables in the pan are seasoned with salt during the vegetable-and-meat cook. Logic holds because both actions are explicitly described and match the query's sequence.",

Step 3: The transition from a single dog near the cooking area (Slice 22) to two dogs resting and playing in the meadow (Slice 83) aligns with the proposed answer. Slice 48 further supports the rural setting and a dog relaxing near food prep, but the key elements are fully covered by Slices 22 and 83.",
