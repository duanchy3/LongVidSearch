Step 2: Slice 28 depicts the next frames as an introduction/title card explicitly labeled 'THE BATTLE OF ISSUS.' Logic holds because the map setup of the imminent battle near the Nur Mountains is followed by the titled battle card, confirming the next named battle shown is The Battle of Issus.",

Clip 2 immediately follows with a title card that explicitly reads 'THE BATTLE OF ISSUS' alongside an illustration of ancient warriors, confirming this is the next named event in the timeline."

Step 3: Slice 28 explicitly introduces another major battle with the title 'THE BATTLE OF ISSUS,' serving as a second set piece.
