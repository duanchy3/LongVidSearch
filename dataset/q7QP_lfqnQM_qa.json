Step 2: Slice 8 shows a later figure with three diagrams labeled (a) Transformer, (b) Synthesizer (Dense), and (c) Synthesizer (Random), indicating Synthesizer variants alongside the Transformer.

Step 2: Slice 59 describes a later analysis showing attention-weight histograms and explicitly mentions it is conducted on the WMT EnDe dataset.

Step 2: Slice 9 explains an attention mechanism and explicitly states that tokens in a sentence such as 'Sarah... she' are represented by vectors, using these as the running example in the self-attention explanation. Logic holds because both slices independently reference 'Sarah' and 'she' as the example tokens, showing consistency across the transition from the simple letter exercise to the attention matrix explanation.",
    "visual_proof": "In both clips, the labels 'Sarah' and 'she' are repeatedly written in green ink beneath the rows of red circles (tokens). In Clip 1, they appear at 0:10 and 0:16. In Clip 2, they are visible at 0:03 and again at 0:22-0:50, consistently associated with specific token positions in both the simple exercise and the more complex attention matrix diagram."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 38 describes a later slide featuring 'Figure 1: The Transformer model architecture' from 'Attention Is All You Need,' clearly depicting the Transformer as the earlier attention-based model with an architecture diagram. Logic holds because the question asks for the alternative approach (synthesizers) and the earlier model contrasted later via an architecture diagram (Transformer), both directly supported by the provided slices.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays the title page of the 'SYNTHESIZER' paper, which explicitly names the proposed approach. Clip 2 shows the architecture diagram from the 'Attention Is All You Need' paper, which is the seminal work introducing the Transformer model. The visual juxtaposition of these two clips confirms that the SYNTHESIZER paper is positioned as an alternative to the original Transformer architecture."

    "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the text explicitly states 'This approach eliminates the dot product altogether by replacing QK^T in standard Transformers with the synthesizing function F(.)'. The formula Y = Softmax(B)G(X) is shown, where B = F(X). In Video 2, Table 1 titled 'Overview of all Synthesizing Functions' is displayed, listing various models like Dot Product Attention, Random, Factorized Random, etc., along with their corresponding S(X) functions."
