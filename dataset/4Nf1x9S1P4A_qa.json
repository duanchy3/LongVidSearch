        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 22 explicitly describes raw meat being coated with vibrant yellow turmeric powder, and the person further sprinkles turmeric, confirming the spice used. Step 2: Slice 58 describes a person pouring tea from a teapot into a glass cup during the cooking scene. Logic holds because both slices are part of the same video context, and each directly supports one part of the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, raw meat pieces are visibly coated with a bright yellow spice, consistent with turmeric. In Clip 2, a dark amber liquid is poured from a metal pot into a traditional Turkish tea glass, which is unmistakably tea."

Step 2: Slice 43 shows lemon being squeezed over sliced red onions in the bowl, indicating the same type of onion mixture is involved. Logic holds because both slices consistently describe sliced onions first seasoned with red spices and later with lemon juice.",

Step 2: Slice 9 explicitly shows red bell peppers being cut into small pieces on a wooden cutting board, confirming the later action involves red bell peppers being cut.

Step 2: Slice 10 shows the same outdoor cooking setup with a large steaming pot and describes the man placing peeled and sliced vegetables (potatoes or similar root vegetables) into the pot. Logic holds because both slices depict the same rustic outdoor cooking scene with a steaming pot, and Slice 10 explicitly mentions adding vegetables into the steaming pot later in the video context.",

Step 2: Slice 93 describes a communal outdoor dining area where several sheep and goats are grazing/moving around, indicating they are wandering. It also mentions a small white dog, but the question focuses on the animals wandering, which are clearly sheep and goats. Logic holds because the animals near the beehives are identified as two dogs, and the animals wandering near the dining area are identified as sheep and goats.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, two dogs (one black and white, one black) are lying down in a grassy field with colorful beehives visible in the background. In Clip 2, multiple sheep and at least one goat are seen walking around a thatched-roof outdoor dining area where people are seated."

Step 2: Slice 61 shows close-up skewers of meat sizzling over an open fire, depicting those items actively cooking earlier.
