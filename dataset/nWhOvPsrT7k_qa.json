        "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 35 shows microscopic crystalline silica particles (jagged) and then lung anatomy. Step 2: Slice 34 provides additional microscopic/biological visuals reinforcing particle-like hazards. Conclusion: The implied link is inhalation of fine silica particles affecting the lungs/airways.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 35 explicitly shows microscopic crystalline silica particles with jagged shapes. Step 2: Slice 35 then transitions to a labeled diagram of the human respiratory system (trachea, bronchial tubes) and later focuses on bronchioles and alveoli. Step 3: Slice 35’s summary states the video provides an overview of crystalline silica, its impact on volcanic eruptions, and its relevance to human health, implying a health link via inhalation. Logic holds because the juxtaposition of silica particles and respiratory anatomy suggests that these particles can enter and affect the lungs/airways. Slice 34 reinforces the microscopic particle theme but is not necessary for the core link.",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip begins with a microscopic view of jagged, irregular particles (0:00-0:10), which are visually consistent with ash or crystalline silica. This is immediately followed by an anatomical diagram of the human respiratory system, labeling the trachea and bronchial tubes (0:22-0:26). The sequence strongly suggests a causal link: these airborne particles enter the labeled respiratory structures. The subsequent chart on magma types and eruption products (0:27-0:49) reinforces the volcanic origin of such particles. The video then zooms into the lungs, showing alveoli and capillaries (0:50-1:03), further detailing where these particles would lodge and cause damage, confirming the suggested link between the particles and the respiratory system."

Conclusion: Massive eruption → tsunami/ocean blasts → sustained dangerous sea conditions.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 23 explicitly describes a dramatic volcanic eruption with magnitude claims (audible thousands of kilometers away, continuing for days/weeks) and then shows tsunami maps and visuals of catastrophic flooding in the Mediterranean. Step 2: Slice 22 shows a massive explosion in the ocean with turbulent water, and Slices 49 and 50 depict stormy, violent ocean conditions (a boat struggling through a storm and a large object emerging/sinking in choppy seas). Logic holds because the answer summarizes the sequence: eruption magnitude -> tsunami devastation -> later ocean turmoil imagery, all directly supported by the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually establishes the eruption's scale with maps showing its audible range (China/NY) and compares it to Krakatoa. It then presents 'BEFORE/AFTER' maps illustrating a hypothetical mega-tsunami flooding the Mediterranean. Clip 2 shows a large wave and an explosion at sea, consistent with tsunami or eruption aftermath. Clip 3 depicts chaotic, stormy seas viewed from a ship, reinforcing the theme of ongoing oceanic turmoil. Clip 4 shows a dark object emerging from turbulent water, suggesting continued disturbance. The sequence logically connects the initial eruption claim to the tsunami scenario and then to lingering, violent ocean imagery."
