    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 1 describes the title slide as 'Interest Point Detection' with 'Lecture-4' below it, clearly supporting the first part of the answer. Step 2: Evidence Slice 10 describes a slide titled 'Where can we use it?' that includes a bullet 'Automate object tracking,' which supports the second part of the answer. Logic holds because both pieces of information are explicitly stated in the provided slices and align with the question's timeline (beginning title slide, later application slide).",
    "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the PowerPoint title slide clearly displays 'Interest Point Detection' with 'Lecture-4' underneath. In Clip 2, the slide titled 'Where can we use it?' shows a bullet point that reads 'Automate object tracking'. Both pieces of information are directly visible in the respective clips."

On this slide, the equation `f ⊗ h = Σ_k Σ_l f(k,l)h(i+k,j+l)` is displayed. Below this equation, the text explicitly defines 'f = Image' and 'f = Kernel', which appears to be a typo in the source material, as the context implies 'h = Kernel'. The subsequent visual of two matrices labeled 'f' and 'h' being operated on confirms that 'f' represents the image and 'h' represents the kernel."
