        "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 5 shows a woman carrying a large pink inflatable flamingo along a garden pathway near a villa. Step 2: Slice 8 shows a pink flamingo-shaped pool float placed on a glass-top table on a covered terrace with checkered flooring and striped lounge chairs. Conclusion: The flamingo float later appears resting on the terrace table.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 5 shows the woman carrying a pink inflatable flamingo along a garden pathway near a luxurious house. Step 2: Slice 8 shows the same pink flamingo float resting on a glass-top table on a covered terrace that has a checkered floor and is furnished with striped lounge chairs. Logic holds because Slice 8 explicitly places the flamingo on a glass-top table in the described terrace setting, matching the details in the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 2, at 0:04, the pink flamingo is visibly resting on the edge of the pool on a covered terrace. The terrace features a black-and-white checkered floor, striped lounge chairs are positioned nearby, and a glass-top table is also present in the scene, matching the description in the original answer."
