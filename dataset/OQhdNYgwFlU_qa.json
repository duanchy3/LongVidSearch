Step 3: Slice 26 also matches the setup, noting olive-green curtains and a poster or artwork on the right.

Step 3: Slice 65 presents an animated character with a circular emblem displaying 'Sci Man Dan,' which serves as an identity screen for the presenter; this aligns with the notion of an identity card and is clearly an animated character identity screen. Step 4: Slice 40 provides consistent context about the video’s speaker but is not necessary for the titles; the essential evidence is in Slices 4, 5, and 65. Logic holds because the names and their presentation formats are explicitly supported by these slices.",
