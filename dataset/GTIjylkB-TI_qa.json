Step 2: Slice 12 shows a handwritten 72 Hour To-Do List that includes the item \"Find 15-30 Guests.\" Step 3: It is reasonable that a blocked account would likely interfere with efforts to find or recruit 15–30 guests (e.g., via an app), aligning the problem with that specific to-do item. While the answer mentions \"for the party,\" the core goal \"Find 15–30 Guests\" is directly supported by the text.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a phone screen with a message: 'This account has been blocked for violations such as harassment, malicious marketing, or fraud.' Clip 2 displays a handwritten to-do list titled '72 Hour To-Do List' with the item 'Find 15-30 Guests' checked off. The blocked account, likely used for communication or social media outreach, would logically hinder efforts to find and coordinate with guests."
