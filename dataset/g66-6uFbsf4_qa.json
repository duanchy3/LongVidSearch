        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 4 states that a small, floating teal circle with a white 'D' appears near the phone in the smartphone animation. Step 2: Slice 8 states that the USB drive has a circular logo on its side that appears to be a stylized letter 'D'. Step 3: Both slices explicitly mention the letter 'D' in the described locations, so the logic holds.",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 32 explicitly states the capsule's on-screen data displays indicate the current altitude as 127,520 feet. Step 2: Slice 41 describes a diagram with a hot air balloon labeled 'Felix' at an altitude of 127,520 feet. Logic holds because both slices mention the same altitude value in their respective contexts.",

In Video 2, the diagram features a hot air balloon with the text 'FELIX @ 127520 FT' next to it. The value '127,520' is identical in both clips, confirming it appears in both contexts."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 12 describes the sponsor URL segment, showing a man in a hoodie in front of an Earth-from-space backdrop within a studio/office that has shelves with various items. Step 2: Slice 40 describes the later discussion of a distance/curvature calculator, again showing the man speaking against a backdrop featuring a large image of Earth from space with shelves containing items. Logic holds because both slices depict the same visual setting (space-themed Earth backdrop and shelves in a studio), tying the sponsor segment to the calculator discussion.",
        "visual_proof": "In both clips, the presenter is consistently shown against the same background: a large image of the Earth as seen from space, set against a starry sky. To his left (viewer's right), there are dark shelves holding various items like books and a YouTube Creator Award. This identical setting visually connects the segment where the sponsor URL appears (Clip 1) to the later discussion involving the calculator (Clip 2)."

Step 2: Slice 54 shows a Guardian webpage that highlights the achievements of SpaceX, detailing its orbital booster landings, satellite production, and missions carrying astronauts. Logic holds because the two slices clearly reference two different companies discussed on Guardian webpages: first Blue Origin, then SpaceX.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a Guardian article titled 'How did Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin fail to dominate the billionaire space race?', explicitly naming Blue Origin.

Step 2: Slice 63 describes a stylized animated logo card explicitly featuring the text 'Sci Man Dan' as a brand identity. Logic holds because the same creator-brand title appears first as on-screen text and later as a dedicated animated logo card.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the text 'Sci Man Dan' appears over a globe at 0:05. In Clip 2, this same text is displayed as part of a dedicated animated logo card, featuring the cartoon character and globe against a blue network background, confirming it returns as a logo card."

Step 2: Slice 6 describes an animated scene about cybersecurity and phishing, matching the 'phishing animation.' Step 3: Slice 11 shows a circular diagram (threat wheel) labeled with threats like 'EMAIL LEAKS,' 'PASSWORD LEAKS,' and 'DATA BREACH.' Logic holds because the sequence transitions from sponsor branding (Surfshark) to a phishing-focused animation and then to a labeled cybersecurity threat diagram.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows the Surfshark logo appearing on screen next to the speaker. Clip 2 displays an animation of red tentacles attacking digital assets like 'Banking credentials,' 'Passwords,' and 'Logins,' representing a cyber threat. Clip 3 presents a circular diagram with a central shield icon and labels for specific threats: 'EMAIL LEAKS,' 'PASSWORD LEAKS,' 'DATA BREACH,' 'IDENTITY THEFT,' and 'HACKED WEBSITES.'

Step 4: Slice 41 presents a simplified diagram comparing eye levels (ground vs balloon at 127,520 ft) and explaining the horizon distance. Conclusion: The explanation progresses from tool → inputs → numerical output → conceptual diagram.",

Step 3: Slice 37 displays computed results from the Earth Curve Calculator, including horizon distance and target hidden height, fulfilling the 'computed numbers' stage. Step 4: Slice 41 presents a simplified diagram with eye levels, horizon distance (438 miles), and hidden height values (e.g., 127661 feet), illustrating the concepts visually.
