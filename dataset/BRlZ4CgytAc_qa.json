    "question": "In the Haiti evacuation story, how is the airport setting established visually before the breaking-news split-screen about U.S. citizens arriving in Florida?",
    "answer": "First, a private jet taxiing and an airport-terminal shot establish the airport setting before the split-screen breaking-news report about arrivals in Florida.",

    "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 9 shows a jet taxiing and an airport terminal environment. Step 2: Slice 10 shows the split-screen breaking-news banner about U.S. citizens fleeing Haiti arriving in Florida with the correspondent in an airport-like hub. Conclusion: The airport visuals in Slice 9 set the scene for the Florida-arrivals report in Slice 10.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 9 describes an exterior shot of a private jet taxiing on a tarmac and then an interior shot of an airport terminal with a man in a dark polo shirt, clearly establishing the airport setting. Step 2: Slice 10 presents the breaking-news split-screen about U.S. citizens fleeing Haiti arriving in Florida. Logic holds because Slice 9 provides the visual establishment of the airport before the split-screen in Slice 10.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually establishes the airport setting with a wide shot of a white private jet taxiing on the tarmac, followed by a medium shot of a reporter standing inside a modern airport terminal. Clip 2 then immediately transitions to a split-screen format showing the same reporter in the terminal alongside a news anchor, with a chyron explicitly stating 'U.S. CITIZENS FLEEING HAITI ARRIVE IN FLORIDA'. This sequence confirms the airport visuals precede the breaking news report."

    "question": "Which visual identifiers show that the same impeachment inquiry theme continues from a named witness at the table to a broader hearing-room wide shot?",

Step 2: Slice 20 shows wide shots of the same type of congressional hearing room with the same impeachment inquiry topic banner. Conclusion: The consistent lower-third and hearing environment indicate continuation of the same inquiry coverage.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 18 describes a named witness at a table with a nameplate and explicitly notes a lower-third banner reading 'IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY FIREWORKS HUNTER BIDEN'S FORMER ASSOCIATES TESTIFY,' confirming the impeachment inquiry theme. Step 2: Slice 20 describes a wider hearing-room shot and states that the lower third displays the same topic ('IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY FIREWORKS' and 'HUNTER BIDEN'S FORMER ASSOCIATES TESTIFY'), and shows the formal panel/witness setting. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention the same lower-third text and consistent hearing-room setting, showing visual continuity from the named witness shot to the wide room shot.",
    "visual_proof": "The lower-third graphic 'IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY FIREWORKS / HUNTER BIDEN'S FORMER ASSOCIATES TESTIFY' is present in both Clip 1 (showing Mr. Bobulinski at the witness table) and Clip 2 (showing a wide view of the hearing room with multiple members and witnesses). The consistent setting, including the wooden paneling, American flag, and formal seating arrangement, confirms it is the same event. This visual evidence links the individual witness testimony to the broader committee hearing context."

    "question": "Which two different on-screen descriptions of the victim’s age appear across the stabbing coverage, and how do later slices clarify the commonly repeated age?",
    "answer": "One part shows 11 years old while another mentions 13 years old; later repeated headlines and segments consistently refer to the victim as 11 years old.",

Step 2: Slice 32 shows a handwritten note describing a 13-year-old boy killed protecting his pregnant mother. Step 3: Slice 33 again labels the story as an 11-year-old killed protecting pregnant mom. Conclusion: Despite a conflicting 13-year mention, the broadcast repeatedly frames the victim as 11.",
    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 29 shows the lower third headline stating \"11-YEAR-OLD KILLED PROTECTING PREGNANT MOM,\" clearly indicating the age as 11.

Step 3: Slice 33 again displays the title card with \"11-YEAR-OLD KILLED PROTECTING PREGNANT MOM,\" reinforcing 11 as the repeatedly shown age in later coverage. Logic holds because slices 29 and 33 consistently present 11, while slice 32 uniquely mentions 13, and the repeated headlines confirm 11 as the commonly repeated age.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (0:00-0:09) and Clip 2 (0:00-0:09) both display the on-screen text '11-YEAR-OLD KILLED PROTECTING PREGNANT MOM'. Clip 3 (0:05-0:06) displays a graphic with the date 'March 13' and the word 'Deadly' partially visible, which may be misinterpreted as referring to the victim's age. However, no clip visually states the victim was 13 years old. The consistent on-screen text across all clips identifies the victim as 11 years old, confirming the original answer's claim that later segments clarify the age as 11."

    "question": "How is the 'homework harassment' story visually built from a police department setting to call transcripts and then to body-camera footage showing charges?",

Step 2: Slice 46 presents on-screen operator call transcript text (operator asks what help is needed; Sizemore asks to talk to the chief), reinforcing the call interaction element and the 'HOMEWORK HARASSMENT' banner. Step 3: Slice 54 shows AXON body-camera footage with on-screen text explicitly listing charges ('two counts of telecommunications harassment' and 'one count of menacing'), completing the progression to body-cam footage with charges. Logic holds because each slice contributes a distinct visual phase: PD/mugshot, call transcript, then body-cam with charges, matching the proposed sequence.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a police detective from the Oxford Police Department, followed by an exterior shot of the department building. Clip 2 displays a mugshot alongside on-screen text transcribing a phone call between an operator and 'Sizemore'. Clip 3 presents body-camera footage with overlaid text explicitly stating 'TWO COUNTS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS HARASSMENT' and 'ONE COUNT OF MENACING', confirming the charges."

Step 3: Slice 27 further shows footage of Donald Trump at a campaign rally and explicitly frames the discussion as 'Trump Coalition Boosts Moreno in Ohio GOP Senate Race.'
