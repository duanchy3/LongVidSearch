Step 2: Slice 72 shows a vault-like room with deposit boxes and a large black box discussed seriously. Conclusion: The key access moment connects to later secure/controlled access around the box in the vault.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 22 explicitly shows a close-up of a hand holding a key and inserting it into a keyhole, demonstrating an object being used to access something. Step 2: Slice 72 describes a secure vault-like environment focused on safety deposit boxes and a large black box during a tense, confidential discussion. Logic holds because the key is an explicitly depicted access tool in Slice 22, and this thematically aligns with the secure, box-centered setting in Slice 72, without requiring a direct causal link.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at 0:13, a hand is explicitly shown picking up a set of keys from a wooden surface. In Clip 2, the scene takes place in a secure, vault-like room filled with safety deposit boxes, and a large black box is placed on a table between two women, serving as the focal point of their serious conversation. The use of a physical key to access a secure item (like a safe or box) directly aligns with the context of the vault and the central black box."

        "question": "Across the video, which sequence best shows a progression from finding hidden evidence to being formally questioned by an investigator in a large house?",

Step 2: Slice 20 shows an investigator questioning a distressed couple inside a large house after a coroner’s van arrives. Step 3: Slice 21 continues the tense exchange/argument dynamic between the couple. Conclusion: The discovery phase transitions into official scrutiny and interrogation pressure.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 18 describes a man and woman in an attic finding hidden items: a photograph, a newspaper clipping about a car accident, and a large amount of cash, clearly supporting the 'finding hidden evidence' part. Step 2: Slice 20 shows the same pair later in a large, imposing house where a woman investigator is present, taking notes, and the couple sits distressed on a couch, with text explicitly suggesting they are being questioned. Step 3: Slice 21 further reinforces the tense couch scene, though it doesn’t mention the investigator. The progression from discovery in the attic to being questioned in a large house is directly supported by Slices 18 and 20, matching the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually confirms the couple finding evidence: a photo (0:07), a newspaper clipping about a car accident (0:11), and a chest full of cash (0:14). Clip 2 shows them sitting on a couch in a large house (0:07-0:09) looking distressed as a woman with a notepad, identified as an investigator by context, stands before them. This sequence directly supports the described progression."

Conclusion: The money transitions from discovery to stash to a direct catalyst in violent conflict.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 18 shows a man and woman in an attic discovering a large amount of hidden cash, clearly establishing the 'discovering money' stage. Step 2: Slice 23 depicts a dimly lit, safe house-like room with stacks of cash prominently displayed, fitting the 'hideout-like space with stacks of cash' stage. Step 3: Slice 49 presents a tense, violent scene where money is scattered on the ground and frantically collected amid a physical altercation, satisfying 'violence centered around that money.' Logic holds because each slice directly corresponds to the escalation stages described in the answer without requiring character continuity.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows characters discovering a chest full of cash in a dim, attic-like space. Clip 2 shows a man in a dark room with stacks of cash on the floor, followed by him looking alarmed and moving through a hallway, suggesting tension or impending conflict. Clip 3 depicts a chaotic scene with hands scrambling to collect scattered cash on the floor, indicating a violent struggle has occurred. This sequence visually supports the escalation described in the answer."

Step 3: Slice 84 shows a dramatic confrontation on a grand staircase where a man in a suit is shot, with Slice 91 showing the aftermath as a woman checks on the fallen man. The logic holds because the progression moves from discovery of a death clue, to official response and investigation, to a later violent shooting in a grand interior.",
