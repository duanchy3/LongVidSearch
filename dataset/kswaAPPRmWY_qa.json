        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 69 describes a pastry being brushed with a yellow liquid (likely egg wash) and then explicitly says sesame seeds are sprinkled over the top. Step 2: Slice 85 describes a baked loaf with a golden-brown crust that is sprinkled with sesame seeds. Logic holds because both slices explicitly state sesame seeds are the sprinkled topping in each scenario.",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 71 explicitly states that a long wooden stick with a metal hook is used to manipulate, stir, and adjust the embers inside the oven, which logically relates to managing heat. Step 2: Slice 77 explicitly shows a round, golden-brown flatbread on a metal tray being removed from the oven using a long-handled tool. Logic holds because the first action manages the oven's heat by adjusting embers, and later a baked flatbread is removed with a long-handled tool, matching the proposed answer.",

The proposed answer aligns with these details.",
