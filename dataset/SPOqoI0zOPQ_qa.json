Step 2: Slice 12 shows the same man in front of a yellow background with the on-screen text '100% FREE' in bold red letters. The two slices logically represent two different solid-color backdrops, and the details directly support the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (green backdrop), at 0:15, a red, round object is visibly falling from above toward the presenter's right hand. In Clip 2 (yellow backdrop), at 0:03, the text '100% FREE' appears in large, bold red letters across the bottom of the screen."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 28 shows a news caption stating 'German startup Aleph Alpha raises $27M Series A round,' which highlights the dollar amount. Logic holds because each slice directly provides the specific figures asked for in the question.",
