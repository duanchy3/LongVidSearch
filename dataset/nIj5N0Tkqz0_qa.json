Step 2: Slice 46 shows an aerial view of a construction site near a tunnel entrance with machinery, and Slice 47 features a JR East representative explaining tunneling challenges due to soft soil—these support construction challenges. Step 3: Slice 50 depicts a ribbon-cutting ceremony and train arrival for the JR Joban Line in Dec. 2016, clearly marking the ceremonial reopening. Logic holds as the slices sequentially cover planning, construction challenges, and reopening.",

Step 3: Slice 50 shows a formal, dated (Dec. 2016) reopening ceremony for the JR Joban Line, including ribbon-cutting and train arrival, clearly indicating 'a reopening ceremony for rail service resumption.' Logic holds because the slices collectively present a progression from damage, through reconstruction, to renewed service.",
