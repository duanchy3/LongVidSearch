        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 6 states that subtitles mention a humorous mix-up involving alcohol being mistaken for water, supporting the first part. Step 2: Slice 16 describes a young man holding a blue mug close to his face, seemingly about to take a sip, which indicates the mug is raised toward his mouth, supporting the second part. Logic holds because these two slices directly answer both parts of the question.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the subtitle at 0:13 explicitly states '*Dylan accidentally brought a bottle of alcohol out thinking it was water*', visually confirming the mistake. In Clip 2, from 0:00 to 0:04, a young man is clearly shown holding and raising a dark blue ceramic mug to his lips."

Step 2: Slice 72 explicitly mentions a story about an angel coming when someone turns 60 and reveals the father died at 58. Step 3: Slice 62 continues the broader theme of discussing stigma and generation over serene aerial visuals, reinforcing reflective narration. Conclusion: The angel theme is introduced via narration and then grounded in a personal story about the father’s age at death.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 60 describes an aerial sequence with a voice-over explicitly about mortality and the presence of an angel, establishing that theme early. Step 2: Slice 72 shows the couch conversation where the speaker references a prior story about an angel coming at age 60 and then reveals his father died at 58, directly connecting the angel/mortality theme to his personal anecdote. Logic holds because the earlier aerial segment sets the angel/mortality context, and the later couch scene revisits and applies that theme to the speaker's father.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (0:04-0:09) shows an aerial view with subtitles 'He told me think about if you're at 60 years old and you're about to die.' Clip 2 (0:03-0:10) shows a man on a couch saying, 'You remember that this story that I told you, 60 years old, the angel will come over. My father died at 58.' This directly links the abstract theme from the aerial shot to the personal story in the conversation. Clip 3 contains no relevant visual information for this connection."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 9 explicitly states a television screen is displaying people walking down an escalator. Step 2: Evidence Slice 23 explicitly describes a later subway-station scene where people are seen descending an escalator. Logic holds because these are two separate moments: one shown on a TV within the video, and another captured directly in a subway station scene. This matches the proposed answer’s identification of a television screen and a subway-station scene showing escalator descents at different times.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a television screen displays security camera footage of a crowded train interior. In Video 2, there are two distinct scenes showing people on escalators: one is a high-angle shot of a person descending an escalator in a subway station (0:09-0:10), and the other is a time-lapse shot of a busy subway station with people moving on escalators (0:13-0:14). The question asks for two different screens showing people descending on escalators; the television screen in Video 1 does not show an escalator, but the subway station scenes in Video 2 do. Therefore, the original answer is incorrect because it incorrectly identifies the television screen as one of the two screens showing escalators. The correct answer should be: 'Two different subway-station scenes (shown as people descending on escalators).'"

Step 2: Slice 22 describes (in another moment) the man holding a red object while speaking and again explicitly says he is wearing a blue hoodie.

In Clip 2 (0:00-0:05), he is again speaking, and another person is holding a red book near him; the man is still wearing the identical blue and black hoodie. The clothing item is consistent across both moments."
