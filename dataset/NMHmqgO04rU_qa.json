Step 2: Slice 35 shows a split-screen where dogs wait by plates of food—one indoors on a green cushion and one outdoors on a tiled patio. Conclusion: The later locations are indoors on a cushion and outdoors on a patio.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 10 states a small dog wearing a pearl necklace is present in the kitchen earlier. Step 2: Slice 35 describes a split-screen where (left) a small fluffy dog with a pearl-like collar is indoors on a green cushion near a plate of food, and (right) another dog is outdoors on a tiled patio near a plate of food. Logic holds because the split-screen explicitly shows the two locations where dogs are waiting near plates of food, directly supporting the answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the dog is shown indoors in a kitchen setting, sitting on a green cushioned stool. In Clip 2, a split-screen shows two photos of the same dog: one photo depicts the dog indoors next to a plate of food, and the other shows the dog from behind, looking at a plate of food while sitting on a tiled patio, indicating an outdoor location."

Step 2: Slice 54 shows salmon being cut into uniform cubes with text guiding to 'Please cut it into cube shape,' confirming the same ingredient is later prepared by cubing. The mention of red sauce is additional context, but the identification of the ingredient is fully supported by the slices.",

Step 2: Evidence Slice 71 states that finely chopped white onions are added to the bowl with salmon and red sauce, with text overlays confirming 'adding onion.'

Step 3: Slice 39 shows a Pomeranian with a pearl-like collar lying relaxed on cushions, indicating the 'relaxing afterward' phase.

Step 2: Slice 47 presents a thick red sauce described on-screen as '기본초장' (basic chili paste) paired with salmon, and the caption notes it is likely gochujang.

In Video 2, a thick red sauce is shown being stirred, with text identifying it as '기본초장' (basic chili sauce/paste), which is contextually linked to the Gochujang shown earlier.

Step 2: Slice 33 shows a chef sprinkling a crunchy topping on spaghetti and labels the finished dish as '빵가루 카레 파스타 완성!'
