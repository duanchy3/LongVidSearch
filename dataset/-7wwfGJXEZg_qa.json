Step 2: Evidence Slice 48 mentions population estimates for Rome including a later year labeled 'CIRCA 536 A.D.' Logic holds because the question asks for the initial year shown and the later year used for a population estimate, both of which are directly provided in the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 clearly displays the text '534 A.D.' overlaid on a scene of marching soldiers. Clip 2 shows an aerial view of Rome with an on-screen graphic titled 'POPULATION OF ROME (ESTIMATES)', which explicitly lists 'CIRCA 536 A.D.' alongside the population figure '100,000'. Both years are directly visible in the provided clips."

Step 2: Slice 53 shows a close-up page of the same titled work, \"History of the Wars\" by Procopius, and specifies Book V, Chapter 20.

The two slices logically connect to answer both parts of the question.",

The slight spelling variation ('Theodoric' vs. 'Theoderic') is acceptable per instructions. The logic holds: the mausoleum is linked to Theodoric, and the later visual device is a family tree centered on a coin noting his death.",

Step 3: Slice 72 again notes Rome and Naples prominently, along with Ravenna and Salona, further confirming the trio appears repeatedly across the maps. The logic holds because each slice independently lists Rome, Naples, and Ravenna as labeled cities on the Italy-focused maps.",

In Clip 1, all three are visible. In Clip 2, the map zooms in but still shows Rome, Ravenna, and Naples. In Clip 3, the map shows the same three cities, with Naples being the focal point of troop movements and naval activity, confirming its centrality to the siege narrative as described in the question."
