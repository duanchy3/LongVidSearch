Despite minor differences in clothing descriptions, both slices consistently identify the bottom-left participant sipping from a white mug, and the later slice shows the same action.

Step 4: Slice 20 also notes a different background (wooden panel with a geometric pattern) for the same bottom-right participant, further supporting that his background changes.
