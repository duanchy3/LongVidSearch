        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 23 states the camera pans up to show a sign that reads 'Giraffe Centre' while featuring a man in a green T-shirt with long hair tied back. Step 2: Slice 26 shows a man with a green shirt and long hair tied back feeding giraffes from a platform. Logic holds because the same visually described man appears in both slices, and the sign explicitly shown before the feeding scene is 'Giraffe Centre.' The context includes only one location sign, which matches the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In the final frame of Video 1, a man is standing in front of a large sign that clearly displays the words \"GIRAFFE CENTRE\" in white capital letters on a dark background. The subsequent clip (Video 2) immediately shows the same man feeding giraffes from a wooden platform, confirming the temporal sequence and location."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 40 states there is a tabletop sign that reads 'Carnivore' and indicates the setting is a restaurant called Carnivore. Step 2: Slice 41 shows the same man in the same restaurant-like environment with the on-screen rating text 'MAYBE A 6.1'. Step 3: Since the scenes are consistent (same person, same setting), the rating appears in the place identified earlier, i.e., the restaurant named on the tabletop sign. Therefore, the restaurant name is 'Carnivore'.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at timestamp 0:12-0:15, the man holds up and then places a small tabletop sign on the table. The sign clearly reads 'CARNIVORE' with the tagline 'A beast of a feast'. This is the only restaurant name visible in either clip."

Step 2: Slice 42 explicitly mentions that the text \"Day 4\" appears on the screen.

        "visual_proof": "The first clip clearly displays the on-screen text 'DAY 4' at timestamp 0:04. The second clip displays the on-screen text 'DAY 6' at timestamp 0:00. Since these clips are from the same continuous video and 'DAY 4' is shown in the first clip while 'DAY 6' is shown in the second, 'DAY 4' logically appears before 'DAY 6'."

Step 2: Slice 41 reinforces the same setting; the man is in a tropical-themed cafe, holding a microphone and speaking, with on-screen text ('MAYBE A 6.1'). Step 3: Slice 42 shows a sequence where 'Day 4' appears on screen, followed by car travel scenes (toll booth, highway driving, man inside car listening to music). Logic holds because the context clearly transitions from the restaurant setting to a labeled travel day in a car with highway footage.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 and 2 show the man inside a restaurant with wooden decor and palm plants, indicating a tropical theme. Clip 3 transitions to a car's interior view with a 'DAY 4' overlay, showing highway driving and the man now driving, confirming the change in setting and context."

Step 3: Slice 70 depicts the man calmly sitting and stirring tea in a cozy room, representing the calm tea moment.
