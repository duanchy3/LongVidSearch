Step 2: Evidence Slice 10 shows a woman approaching the lamp on a table and turning it on, illuminating the room. Logic holds because the later action of turning the lamp on demonstrates that the setup was successful.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, she is seen unpacking and assembling the lamp components on a table. In Video 2, the same lamp is shown fully assembled and turned on, casting a warm glow in the room. The woman then appears next to it, gesturing towards the lit lamp, confirming its successful setup."

Step 2: Slice 27 shows a person holding a photo album or scrapbook filled with photographs and placing it on a bookshelf. Logic holds because the keepsake items first appear as individual photographs being handled and later as photographs compiled in an album that is stored on a bookshelf. This supports the answer that they are photographs/photo pages that become part of a photo album or scrapbook.",

The person then takes this sheet and places it onto a shelf in a bookcase, indicating they are collectible items being stored."

Step 2: Slice 34 shows a person on the floor surrounded by picture frames and artworks, actively sorting, selecting, and placing pieces into frames. Logic holds because the earlier activity in Slice 34 involves choosing and framing items, which would naturally lead to the later display on the wall seen in Slice 42.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a person sitting on the floor surrounded by numerous empty frames and various artworks, actively sorting through them and placing pictures into frames. Clip 2 shows the same person hanging the resulting framed pieces on a wall above a TV, using a hammer. The direct visual sequence from sorting on the floor to hanging on the wall confirms that the floor activity produced the items being displayed."

Step 2: Slice 9 shows the same woman in the same setting turning on a lamp that illuminates the room, demonstrating it working.
