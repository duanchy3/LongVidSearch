Step 3: Slice 51 further depicts arranging individual flowers in a clear glass vase in a home environment. Logic holds because the context explicitly describes the bouquet shifting from wrapped and priced to unwrapped, cut, and arranged into a vase at home.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the bouquet is shown being wrapped in white paper with red floral patterns while the on-screen text mentions the $20 price. In Clip 2 and Clip 3, the same flowers are visibly unwrapped, with stems being cut and arranged individually into a clear glass vase at home."

Step 2: Slice 33 shows her walking into a store and picking up a package of pickled plum while still with flowers. Step 3: Slice 35 shows her selecting strawberries and looking at chocolate while holding the bouquet. Conclusion: While carrying flowers, she shops for reading material and also for food/ingredients.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 31 shows the woman in a bookstore, holding the bouquet, with text overlays 'wanted a new book' and 'romance book or maybe not,' which supports that she is browsing for a book while carrying flowers. Step 2: Slice 35 shows her in a grocery-type store, still holding the bouquet, where she picks up strawberries and also picks up (then puts back) a chocolate bar, and eventually carries strawberries out. This supports that she picked up grocery items like strawberries/chocolate while carrying flowers. The answer's claims are directly supported by these slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, she is seen inside a bookstore with shelves labeled 'Science & Math' and text overlay stating 'wanted a new book', all while holding the bouquet. In Clips 2 and 3, she is shown in grocery stores (Japanese supermarket and Trader Joe's), selecting items like pickled plums, strawberries, and chocolate bars, consistently carrying the same bouquet throughout."

Step 2: Slice 11 repeats 'today is so far so good' after class/food and mentions pottery plans. Step 3: Slice 13 shows her continuing the day with later transitions (bathroom concern then train). Conclusion: The same phrase recurs in different day contexts—early outdoor optimism versus later post-class planning.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 1 explicitly shows the text overlay 'today is so far so good' during an outdoor scene where the person stands by a tree, indicating early-day contentment. Step 2: Evidence Slice 11 explicitly shows the same text overlay later, after classroom and food updates, and mentions plans for a pottery activity for Valentine’s Day. Logic holds because both slices independently confirm the same overlay appearing at distinct times with different surrounding contexts (outdoor early vs. post-class/food with pottery planning).",
        "visual_proof": "The text 'today is so far so good' first appears at 0:04 in Clip 1, overlaid on an outdoor scene where she is walking. It reappears at 0:14 in Clip 2, immediately after she finishes eating her sandwich (post-class) and announces her plan to go paint pottery, indicating a positive update on her day's progress."
