        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 11 lists \"LATRINES\" among labeled trench features. Step 2: Slice 14 also includes \"Latrines\" as a labeled area on the trench map. Logic holds because the same facility is explicitly labeled in both maps, indicating its inclusion as a standard, planned component of the trench system, which implies sanitation needs were addressed within the infrastructure.",
        "visual_proof": "The 'LATRINES' label is clearly visible in both clips. In Clip 1 (0:06-0:10), it is shown as a distinct section connected to the Fire Trench. In Clip 2 (0:11-0:17), it appears again in the same relative position on the map, confirming its presence across both views. The consistent labeling indicates it was a formally designated and essential part of the trench system's design."

Step 3: Slice 33 further supports the hot drink/meal context among soldiers by depicting them heating sustenance over a small fire in a war zone.
