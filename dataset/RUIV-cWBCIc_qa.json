        "question": "Early in the video, a diagram explains polyethylene being made from crude oil and natural gas. Later, a scene shows burning material with on-screen text about burning plastic.

Step 2: Slice 55 shows a fire and text 'As soon as you burn plastic,' linking plastics to air pollution. Conclusion: Fossil-fuel-derived plastics may end up burned, contributing to pollution.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 13 shows a diagram that polyethylene (a plastic) is produced from crude oil and natural gas, establishing its fossil-fuel origin. Step 2: Slice 55 shows a scene of thick, dark smoke with the on-screen text 'As soon as you burn plastic,' and mentions 'possibly toxic emissions' and smoggy conditions. Logic holds because the video juxtaposes plastic’s fossil-fuel origin with scenes of burning plastic producing smoke/toxic emissions, suggesting that plastics made from fossil fuels, when burned, cause harmful pollution.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually establishes the origin of polyethylene from crude oil and natural gas via a diagram. Clip 2 shows large-scale burning/smoldering material with smoke and birds flying away, implying environmental harm or pollution. The juxtaposition of these scenes in the same video suggests a causal relationship: plastic (from fossil fuels) being burned leads to pollution."

        "question": "One segment shows an old TV in a dim room playing a tense sequence, then abruptly cuts to an advertisement that says 'Plastic makes it possible.' Later, the video shows a graph of global plastics production rapidly increasing. How do these two parts together frame the impact of plastic?",

Step 2: Slice 24 shows global plastics production skyrocketing from 1950 to 2016. Conclusion: Together they frame how promotional messaging helped normalize plastic as production exploded.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 23 describes a tense sequence on an old TV that abruptly cuts to a commercial with the slogan 'Plastic makes it possible,' explicitly promoting the benefits and versatility of plastic—indicative of marketing optimism. Step 2: Slice 24 shows a graph titled 'Global plastics production' with a sharp rise from ~1 million tons in 1950 to over 300 million tons by 2016, suggesting massive growth. Logic holds because presenting an upbeat plastic advertisement alongside data showing rapid production increase creates a contrast between optimistic marketing and the reality of large-scale plastic proliferation.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a vintage TV playing an advertisement with the slogan 'Plastic makes it possible,' which promotes a positive, optimistic view of plastic. Clip 2 immediately follows with a graph titled 'Global plastics production' that visually demonstrates a steep, exponential increase in production from 1990 to 2010, highlighting the scale and rapid growth of plastic use. The juxtaposition of the upbeat ad with the stark data graph creates a clear contrast between marketing messaging and industrial reality."

        "question": "A presenter shows a 'Resin Identification Code' chart with seven plastic categories and also states there are '50 different types of plastics.' Elsewhere, a coffee cup lid is shown with recycling symbols. What is the implied reason the cup lid’s symbols matter?",

Step 2: Slice 27 includes a coffee cup lid with recycling symbols and states the video aims to raise awareness about waste management and the importance of recycling. Logic holds because the chart and emphasis on many plastic types establish that identification symbols help determine the plastic type, and the presence of such symbols on the lid implies they matter for correct sorting and recycling.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays the 'Resin Identification Code' chart with seven categories, while text on screen states there are '50 different types of plastics,' implying a need for classification. Clip 2 shows a coffee cup lid with embossed symbols (including a recycling triangle), followed by scenes of massive plastic waste piles and recycling facilities, visually connecting the symbols to the challenge of sorting diverse plastics for recycling."

Step 2: Slice 29 shows the same presenter (black shirt, frosted-glass window) holding headphones and a water bottle. Logic holds because the later scene introduces objects (headphones and water bottle) not present or emphasized in the earlier talking-head shot, and the consistent visual attributes (black shirt, frosted-glass window) link the scenes despite minor setting differences.",

        "question": "One segment visualizes plastic at the molecular level and then shows a landfill. Another later segment shows plastic pollution with a diver underwater. What type of location is used in both segments to emphasize the end result of plastic waste?",

Step 2: Slice 20 includes an underwater plastic scene and also returns to landfill imagery to emphasize waste consequences. Conclusion: Both use landfill/dump imagery to stress plastic’s end-of-life impact.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 19 describes an animation of plastic at the molecular level followed by a scene shifting to a vast landfill, emphasizing plastic waste accumulation. Step 2: Slice 20 opens with a diver underwater surrounded by plastic, then transitions to a large landfill. Logic holds because both segments explicitly feature a landfill as the location that highlights the end result of plastic waste.",
        "visual_proof": "The first segment explicitly shows a massive pile of plastic waste, which is characteristic of a landfill, after visualizing the molecular structure of plastic. The second segment also features a large, sprawling landfill with a bulldozer and animals scavenging on top of the trash heap, reinforcing the concept of a landfill as the end destination for plastic waste. While the underwater scene with the diver is mentioned in the question, it is not present in the provided clips; however, the consistent visual theme across both segments shown is the landfill."

Step 2: Slice 63 presents a map stating that 1.5 to 2.4 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year, with a highlighted source region (notably noting 1/5 from the Philippines).
