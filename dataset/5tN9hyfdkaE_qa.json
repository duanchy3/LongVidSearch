        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 11 shows a close-up of bubble tea with on-screen ingredient labels: Milk, Tea, Sugar, Tapioca Pearls. Step 2: Slice 12 shows a person holding a branded cup of bubble tea from 'Super Bubble Station,' described as creamy milk tea with tapioca pearls. Logic holds because both slices consistently depict bubble tea, first with its ingredients listed and later in a branded cup from a specific shop.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a cup of bubble tea is shown with on-screen text listing its ingredients: 'Tapioca Pearls', 'Sugar', 'Tea', and 'Milk/Syrup/Fruit'. In Video 2, the same type of drink is shown being handed over in a branded cup from 'Super Bubble Station' and subsequently consumed by a man. The visual continuity of the drink type across both clips confirms the answer."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 40 shows a news broadcast dated March 23, 2020 with the caption 'Boris Johnson announces complete UK lockdown.' Step 2: Slice 41 describes a document discussing the COVID-19 pandemic and explicitly mentions that Chinese restaurants struggled due to lockdown measures. Logic holds because the major national event (UK COVID-19 lockdown) is both shown in the news clip and discussed in the document as impacting Chinese restaurants.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a news clip of Boris Johnson announcing the UK lockdown on March 23, 2020. This is directly followed by visuals of an empty Chinatown restaurant with the year '2020' overlaid and a headline from Eater London stating 'Chinatown's Restaurants Are Scared for the Area's Future' due to the pandemic. Clip 2 reinforces this by showing text from articles discussing how Chinatown restaurant owners feared stigma and racism would hamper recovery during the pandemic, and mentions a 300% rise in hate crimes against Asians in the first quarter of 2020, directly linking the struggles of Chinese restaurants to the COVID-19 period."

Step 2: Slice 25 shows a stylized city map with a red circular overlay labeled 'Limehouse Chinatown' and a blue rectangular overlay labeled 'Soho,' both highlighting areas on the map. Logic holds because in both instances the visuals involve a map graphic and on-screen labeled overlays used to identify and highlight specific districts.",

Clip 2 uses a modern, stylized map with colored shapes and text overlays to label 'Limehouse Chinatown' and 'Soho'.

Step 2: Slice 45 states that dim sum is a featured stop in a TikTok-style Chinatown food crawl, explicitly labeled 'DIM SUM IN CHINATOWN.' Logic holds because the same food—dim sum—fits both the indoor nighttime chopsticks scene and the highlighted Chinatown feature.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a person is shown eating steamed dumplings with chopsticks inside a restaurant at night; these are a type of dim sum. In Clip 2, the TikTok-style food crawl explicitly features 'DIM SUM IN CHINATOWN' and shows custard bao buns, which are also a form of dim sum, being eaten."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 45 describes a separate Chinatown food clip that ends with the text 'TOTAL SPENT £3.75' for taiyaki. Logic holds because the question asks for the later price shown at the end of another food clip following the thumbs-up moment, and Slice 45 explicitly provides that price.",

Later in Video 2, at timestamp 0:03, a close-up shot shows a food item (custard bao buns) with a price tag clearly visible on the display case that reads '£3.75'."

Step 2: Slice 61 describes nighttime scenes with strings of red lanterns hanging above the street while the host talks, making them a central decorative element overhead. Logic holds because both slices explicitly reference red lanterns in prominent positions, first as part of the street/restaurant decor and later as overhead decorations during the host's nighttime narration.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (0:00), red lanterns are prominently visible hanging from the ornate Chinese archway, establishing them as a key neighborhood feature. In Clip 2 (0:00-0:01), the same style of red lanterns is seen strung across the street directly above the host's head as he speaks at night, confirming they serve as a central decorative element in both contexts."
