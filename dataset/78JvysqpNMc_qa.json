Step 2: Slice 2 shows a rotating white DNA helix in the animated sequence before transitioning to a live-action presenter, indicating the genetics symbol appears prior to the live-action segment. The question’s phrasing of 'quiz show' versus 'live-action segment' is a naming mismatch, which is acceptable per instructions. Therefore, the answer aligns with both slices.",

In Video 2, a large white DNA double helix rotates vertically on screen at 0:01, followed by the SciShow logo and then the live-action host at 0:06."

The scenes feature the same trio (woman with red hair in black shirt, man in red hoodie) despite different curtain colors, which is acceptable per instructions.
