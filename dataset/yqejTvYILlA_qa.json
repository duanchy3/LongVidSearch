Step 2: Evidence Slice 5 describes a later scene with a man discussing currency conversion in an airport/travel hub, with a currency exchange board visible, clearly indicating a currency exchange setting. Logic holds because the early shot's clothing color (white shirt) and the later scene's setting (airport/currency exchange) directly match the proposed answer.",

In Clip 2 (0:00-0:05, 0:10-0:13), the same man, now wearing a green tank top, is standing in what appears to be a currency exchange office, with a digital rate board and money counting machines visible in the background, confirming the setting for the later money discussion."

Step 2: Slice 48 shows the same red truck scene with a large animal, described as possibly a cow or a water buffalo, lying on the road near the truck. Logic holds because both slices consistently reference the red truck and explicitly note the animal lying near it, matching the proposed answer.",

Logic holds because both requested details are directly named in the provided slices.",
