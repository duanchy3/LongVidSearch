        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 2 states the video begins by introducing Greenland with title text, establishing the initial context. Step 2: Evidence Slice 99 explicitly describes a black screen displaying the question \"Where to next?\" in white letters. Although Slice 99 notes this occurs at the beginning of that segment, the key fact needed is the exact question text shown on a black screen. Sequencing mismatches can be attributed to VLM noise; the question text itself is clearly supported. Therefore, the context supports that the question asked on a black screen is \"Where to next?\"",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip opens with the word 'Greenland' displayed in white text on a black screen. The second clip shows a black screen with the text 'Where to next?' appearing in white, which matches the original answer."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 82 shows two men having coffee at a kitchen table; one wears a blue jacket with a fur-lined hood and a black beanie, the other wears a green jacket—indicating cold-weather gear. Step 2: Slice 69 describes a man in a green jacket outside in a snowy environment giving instructions about snowmobiling, followed by scenes of gearing up and riding a snowmobile. Step 3: The shared attribute (green jacket) links the kitchen scene to the outdoor activity. Step 4: The outdoor winter transport explicitly depicted is snowmobiling.",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip shows two men in heavy winter jackets and beanies drinking coffee indoors. The second clip features the same two men, identifiable by their faces and clothing (e.g., the man in the green jacket), now outdoors in a snowy environment. They are seen preparing gear next to snowmobiles and later riding them, with on-screen text explicitly stating 'Qamutit snowmobiling'. This directly links their indoor attire to the outdoor activity of snowmobiling."

Step 2: Slice 8 shows (later) a man in a snowy setting wearing a green jacket and black beanie entering a hotel with a sign 'Hotel Hans Egede' and then being inside a room. Logic holds because the clothing and continuous travel narrative link the airport arrival in Greenland to the subsequent hotel check-in, explicitly naming the hotel.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the traveler is seen walking into an airport building with a sign that reads 'Welcome to Colourful Nuuk'. In Video 2, the same traveler is shown standing outside a building with large gold lettering on the facade that clearly says 'HOTEL HANS EGDE'. He then enters this hotel and proceeds down a hallway to his room. This sequence confirms he checked into Hotel Hans Egede after arriving at the airport."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 6 shows the arrival phase at the airport with the individual wearing a green jacket and a beanie. Step 2: Slice 31 also shows the man in a green jacket and a beanie, reinforcing the headwear during the early phase. Step 3: Slice 77 shows a cozy wooden cabin interior where a person in a bright green jacket is wearing an orange-and-black motorcycle helmet. Step 4: The clothing (green jacket) and context (later phase involving snowmobile gear) logically link the same person across slices. Therefore, the headwear changes from a beanie at the airport to an orange-and-black helmet inside the cabin.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, at the airport, the man is clearly wearing a grey beanie. In Clip 4, while inside the wooden cabin, he is wearing a full-face orange-and-black snowmobile helmet with a mounted camera."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 6 shows arrival by plane (Air Greenland) and entering an airport terminal in Greenland, supporting the 'arrival at the airport.' Step 2: Slice 7 shows the travelers entering a building marked 'Nuuk,' placing them in Nuuk; Slice 8 then shows them at 'Hotel Hans Egede' and inside a hotel room, indicating they are settling/staying there. Step 3: Slice 17 shows the person hiking up a snowy hill to a statue overlooking water, matching the 'statue hike overlooking water.' The sequence from airport arrival to being in Nuuk/hotel to hiking is logically supported across these slices.",

Clip 3 features the protagonist outside Hotel Hans Egede and entering a room. Clip 4 depicts hiking up a snowy hill to a large statue, followed by views of the sea and another coastal statue, confirming the sequence from arrival to hotel stay to statue hike."
