Step 2: Slice 18 describes a bustling urban street scene in Istanbul with subtitles like 'We're here,' 'Is this it?,' 'Okay, I will come in 5 minutes,' and 'We'll see you then,' indicating coordination for a meet-up. Thus, it confirms a busy city street meet-up scene. The logic connects the reflection in the taxi to the later meet-up scene.",
