In Clip 2, the same person's hands are shown using the same small knife to peel the dry, papery root end off a white bulb of garlic. The actions and ingredients are clearly distinct and visible in each close-up shot."

Step 3: Slice 93 shows a later scene where the man is eating a meal that appears to be fish with salad at the same type of snowy outdoor table, indicating a final eating scene with a different main protein. The environment and attire are consistent, supporting continuity. Therefore, the shift from cutting raw meat to eating fish with salad is explicitly supported.",
