        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 38 shows the text 'for 30 days' on a black screen, explicitly stating a time-span and suggesting it could be for a challenge or commitment. Step 2: Slice 89 presents an Audible advertisement explicitly offering a 'free 30-day trial' and mentions 'free annual membership for 30 days,' repeating the same time-span. Logic holds because the exact phrase '30 days' appears as a duration initially and is repeated as the offer period in the ad.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 displays the text 'for 30 days' in yellow on a black background. Clip 2, showing an Audible advertisement, explicitly states 'Start your free 30-day trial' and repeats 'Free membership for 30 days' in the bullet points. Both clips visually confirm the time-span of 30 days."
