        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 52 describes a dorm room scene with desk work (one person seated at a desk with a laptop) and details the room environment. Step 2: The same slice transitions to a planning moment featuring a close-up of a hand pointing at a map on the wall, indicating destinations. Step 3: Both scenes occur within the same dorm room, and the map on the wall is explicitly identified in the planning scene, serving as a common object present in the room that connects the desk-work scene to the planning scene. Step 4: The proposed answer matches this explicitly supported object.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 2, a large world map is clearly visible on the wall above the desk where the man is working (0:05-0:08). Later in the same clip, another person points directly at North America on this same map while discussing destinations (0:28-0:31). This visually connects the desk-work scenes to the planning scene."

Step 2: Slice 36 later shows the young man in a bedroom/study area with string lights and posters behind him, talking to the camera. Logic holds because the same aesthetic elements (string lights, personal decor) reappear during a vlog-style segment where he speaks to the camera, consistent with the proposed answer.",

Step 3: Slice 71 shows a collage wall covered with postcards depicting various landscapes, handwritten notes, and banknotes from different countries, directly reinforcing the travel and memorabilia theme.

Step 3: Slice 87 shifts to a broader motivational message (“Push the boundaries... Express yourself...”) presented alongside a nighttime cityscape.
