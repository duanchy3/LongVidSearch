        "question": "Which curator appears first talking in the gallery in a gray blazer over a pink top and later is seen again walking up to a relief sculpture wearing the same gray blazer?",
        "answer": "The curator in the gray blazer over a pink top (Brinda Kumar).",

        "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 4 introduces a curator wearing a gray blazer over a pink top while speaking in the gallery. Step 2: Slice 9 shows a woman in a gray blazer approaching and studying a relief sculpture. Conclusion: The matching outfit indicates the same curator (Brinda Kumar).",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 4 states the video opens with a woman in a gray blazer over a pink top in the gallery, and identifies Brinda Kumar as a curator present, explicitly noting Brinda is in a gray blazer (while Kelly is in a black floral blouse). Step 2: This matches the description of the curator talking in the gallery in a gray blazer over a pink top, pointing to Brinda Kumar. Step 3: Slice 9 shows a woman in a gray blazer approaching a relief sculpture. Given Slice 4 already established Brinda as the curator in a gray blazer and Kelly is not wearing a gray blazer, the visual attributes align logically that the same curator (Brinda) is seen again. There is no conflicting information. Therefore, the context supports that the curator is Brinda Kumar.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, Brinda Kumar is clearly identified by on-screen text while speaking in the gallery, wearing a gray blazer over a pink top. In Video 2, the same woman, identifiable by her appearance and attire (gray blazer), is seen walking towards a large silver relief sculpture. The continuity of her clothing and presence across both clips confirms she is the individual described in the question."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 14 describes a framed portrait behind a speaker showing a man in a red shirt and glasses. Step 2: Slice 17 again describes the framed portrait with the man wearing glasses and a red shirt. Step 3: Slice 15 presents a close-up of a man wearing large, round glasses and a red shirt. Logic holds because both the close-up and the framed portrait consistently identify the man by his red shirt and glasses, despite minor hair description variations.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the framed portrait behind the speaker clearly shows a man in a red button-down shirt and large-framed glasses. Clip 2 provides a close-up of the same man's face, confirming the identical red shirt collar and the specific style of his glasses. Clip 3 is another full shot of the same framed portrait, again showing the consistent red shirt and glasses, visually linking all depictions to the same subject."
