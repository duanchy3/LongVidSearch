        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 36 shows a man placing a raw chicken on a rustic table and cutting it into pieces, establishing the raw ingredient preparation. Step 2: Slice 50 shows several pieces of raw chicken cooking in a boiling pot, indicating the transition to cooking. Step 3: Slice 90 shows a close-up of a plated, appetizing dish with the man preparing/serving it, reflecting the plating of the cooked food. Step 4: Slice 92 shows an outdoor picnic where an adult serves food and children are eating at a table, demonstrating the final serving and eating stage. Logic holds because the slices collectively depict the progression from raw prep to cooking, plating, and communal eating, which matches the proposed answer's sequence.",

Step 2: Slice 31 shows the terracotta pot and herbs being handled as part of preparation. Step 3: Slice 29 shows a large clay pot with dark liquid with vegetables around it, and vegetables being added. Step 4: Slice 30 shows green peppers being placed into the clay pot as part of the meal. Conclusion: A terracotta-pot herb/seed prep leads into a clay-pot cooking phase where vegetables are added.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 28 shows a terracotta pot with a person placing dried herbs and then pouring small light-colored seeds into it. Step 2: Slice 31 reinforces the setup with the man handling a terracotta pot and herbs in an outdoor, traditional context. Step 3: Slice 29 shows a large clay pot containing a dark liquid, with bowls of vegetables (green peppers, tomatoes, sliced cucumbers) and the man adding ingredients from these bowls into the pot. Step 4: Slice 30 specifically shows green peppers being placed into a large clay pot. Logic holds because the context clearly depicts an initial stage with herbs/seeds in a terracotta pot, followed by a later stage adding vegetables into a large clay pot with dark liquid. The proposed answer mirrors this sequence without asserting unsupported links between the pots.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows dried herbs being dropped into a terracotta pot, followed by seeds being poured in. Clip 3 and Clip 4 show the same pot now containing dark liquid, into which the man adds garlic cloves, red berries, and green peppers. The consistent use of the same large clay pot across clips confirms the sequence: herbs/seeds are added first, then vegetables are layered into the same pot with dark liquid."
