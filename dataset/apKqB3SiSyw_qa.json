Step 2: Slice 46 describes a later close-up of a computer screen with a confirmation \"Safe\" and a green checkmark, indicating that $353.73 has been captured.

Step 2: Slice 46 transitions to a park where several people are carrying large boxes, with the $848 price tag still visible, linking this scene to the prior context. Step 3: Slice 48 later shows a living room with a red Coca-Cola cooler, matching the Coca-Cola brand theme from the electronics store. The logic holds because the $848 context leads into the park scene with box carrying, and the later indoor object explicitly shares the Coca-Cola branding.",

The question asks for the day numbers shown with a bright orange label, which only appears in the second clip as 'DAY 3'. The first clip's label is yellow, not orange.
