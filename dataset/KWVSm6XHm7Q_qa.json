        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 1 describes an early montage where an open suitcase is being packed with clothes and accessories, indicating preparation for a trip. Step 2: Slice 15 shows a scene labeled as the next day with a woman preparing for a trip and packing items into a large black suitcase. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention a suitcase being packed in travel-prep contexts, appearing first in the early montage and then again the next day.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:07), a person is seen loading a dark-colored suitcase into the trunk of a car. In Video 2 (0:09), the same suitcase, identifiable by its color and red/yellow stripe, is shown standing in a room with clothes on top of it, during a scene labeled 'the next day'. This confirms the same travel item appears in both clips."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 49 explicitly states that the roommates love Kayla and that she is already well-bonded with a direct roommate. Logic holds because the proposed answer restates the chair-napping routine and the bonding with roommates as described in the slices.",

Conclusion: Dining hall meals are shown first, then later she motivates cooking/kitchen use due to bland dining hall food.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 22 shows the person at a campus-like dining hall salad bar around lunchtime, selecting items, implying they are having a dining hall salad. Step 2: Slice 40 shows a kitchen with text overlays stating the narrator often ends up in the kitchen because the 'dining room' food gets bland after about a week. Step 3: The logic links the dining hall salad experience with the later commentary: initial dining hall use followed by a shift to using the kitchen due to bland dining food. The slight 'dining room' vs 'dining hall' wording likely reflects caption noise, but the context supports the intended meaning.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually confirms the person is eating at the dining hall for lunch, specifically getting a salad. Clip 3 features on-screen text where the person states they often find themselves in the kitchen 'because the dining room food gets really bland after around a week,' directly linking the initial dining hall meal to their later reliance on cooking."

Step 2: Slice 8 then depicts arrival at a campus setting, where they are shown unloading items from the car; the man picks up a large black bag and the woman holds another, and they head toward a dorm/building.
