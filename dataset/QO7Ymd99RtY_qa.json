        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 2 states the video begins with text 'Shipping from within' and specifically highlights 'Europe' in yellow, identifying the highlighted region as Europe. Step 2: Slice 9 shows a passport with the text 'ST KITTS AND NEVIS CITIZENSHIP PROGRAM' on the cover, explicitly indicating it is from St. Kitts and Nevis. The two slices logically correspond to the question’s two parts.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the text 'Shipping from within Europe' appears with 'within Europe' highlighted in yellow. In Video 2, a blue passport is shown with the text 'ST. CHRISTOPHER (ST. KITTS) AND NEVIS' clearly visible on its cover."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 50 states the man uses a key card to unlock a door with the number '474' visible next to it. Step 2: Slice 52 describes the same-looking individual (blue shirt, backpack) pulling back curtains to reveal a sliding glass door leading to a balcony that overlooks calm ocean waters, i.e., an ocean view. Logic holds because the visual attributes and actions align, and the instructions allow for minor naming/color discrepancies. Both details explicitly support the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the man uses a key card to unlock a door clearly labeled '474'. In Clip 2, he pulls back sheer curtains to reveal a balcony with a white railing, overlooking red-roofed buildings, lush greenery, and a clear blue sky above a visible expanse of ocean."

Step 2: Slice 33 mentions a sign reading 'Nevis Island Assembly (Birthplace of Alexander Hamilton),' clearly identifying the historical figure and birthplace. Logic holds because the date from the ship scene (Slice 24) and the later sign about a birthplace (Slice 33) directly correspond to the question.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the number '1493' is clearly displayed as text over the image of a sailing ship. In Video 2, a white sign mounted on a stone wall explicitly reads 'NEVIS ISLAND ASSEMBLY (Birthplace of Alexander Hamilton)'."

Step 2: Slice 39 reports text overlays saying, 'Let me get someone' and 'and I'll be right back' during the interaction with the woman in the car. Logic holds because the question asks for the exact request and the subsequent promise; both phrases are directly quoted from the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, at 0:07, the subtitle 'Can you just help us?' appears as a person walks near the ocean. In Video 2, at 0:00-0:02, the subtitle 'Let me get someone and I’ll be right back' is shown while a woman in a car speaks to someone outside."

The two men work together to fix it, indicating the problem that starts the roadside teamwork is a flat tire with a large tear. Step 2: Slice 44 later shows a group changing a tire using a red jack, explicitly mentioning the red jack and a lug wrench.
