Step 2: Slice 86 shows a person in boots walking down a dirt path carrying a woven basket. Conclusion: The repeated woven basket links the early travel moment to the later walking scene.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 2 states that a man in a lush green valley is carrying a large woven basket early on. Step 2: Slice 86 describes a person walking down a dirt path carrying a woven basket in their hand. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention a woven basket being carried in the respective scenes, matching the answer's two parts.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1 (0:00-0:03), the man is seen from behind carrying a large woven basket in his left hand. In Clip 2 (0:00-0:04), a person (presumably the same man) is shown from the waist down carrying a similar woven basket while walking along a dirt path on a hillside. The visual evidence confirms that a woven basket is carried in both instances."

Step 2: Slice 62 shows meat being cooked over an open fire; while it is labeled \"meat\" rather than specifically \"chicken,\" it supports the cooking phase in this outdoor sequence. Additionally, Slice 81 shows cooked, shredded chicken (or a very similar protein) in a pan, indicating the chicken has been cooked. Step 3: Slice 81 clearly depicts the cooked shredded chicken being placed into a bread roll, completing the transition to sandwich filling. Logic holds because the sequence of marinade (Slice 21) → cooking (Slices 62 and/or 81) → sandwich assembly (Slice 81) is present, and minor label ambiguity (meat vs. chicken) is acceptable under VLM noise handling.",

Step 2: Slice 50 shows (in a very similar mountainous setting) the man preparing food, slicing a long green vegetable on a cutting board with other ingredients present, clearly indicating culinary use. Logic holds because the first scene treats the green plant as material to be worked/stripped, and the later scene treats a similar green plant as a food ingredient being sliced. Minor clothing color differences can be attributed to VLM noise as allowed; the actions and context align.",
