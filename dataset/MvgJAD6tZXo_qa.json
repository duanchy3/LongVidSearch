        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 22 describes a chase through an industrial factory with heavy machinery and workers, then out onto a street and into a forested area. Step 2: Slice 77 describes a chase in a gritty, working-class slum-like alley with dilapidated shacks, unpaved ground, and barriers. Logic holds because both slices depict pursuits but in distinctly different environments: industrial-to-street/woods versus a slum alley with makeshift structures.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows the pursued person running through a dark, cluttered industrial factory with machinery, then exiting into a narrow brick alley, followed by a street with horse-drawn carriages, and finally an aerial shot of him running on a dirt path through a wooded, rural area. Clip 2 depicts a different chase scene where the pursued man runs through a dilapidated, open-air slum area characterized by wooden shacks, tarps, and makeshift barricades, with impoverished families visible in the background."

Step 2: Slice 86 describes an indoor library/study setting with a close-up of hands (one gloved) pointing at a handwritten letter, indicating an indoor examination. Logic holds because the proposed answer matches both the locations and actions depicted in the two slices.",

Step 2: Slice 27 describes a later, darker setting featuring a bed near a window with bars, suggesting a prison-like environment, which echoes confinement. Logic holds because both elements are explicitly mentioned and align with the themes described.",

Conclusion: The hat-and-dog pairing tracks the same woman across locations.",

A woman enters holding a small white dog, wearing a white dress and a wide-brimmed hat adorned with flowers, and approaches the man. Logic holds because both slices consistently associate the woman with a white dress, an elaborate floral white hat, and a small white dog, and the settings match the proposed answer: outdoor social gathering/garden party and indoors with a man writing.",

Step 2: Slice 29 describes a Victorian-dressed man tipping his top hat to acknowledge someone, a clear formal gesture. Logic holds because both moments depict men in period dress performing formal acknowledgment gestures: a likely handshake and a hat tip.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, two men in period dress are shown engaging in a handshake at a doorway, a gesture of formal greeting. In Clip 2, a man in a top hat performs a clear tipping motion of his hat with his hand, another traditional formal acknowledgment. Both gestures are visually distinct and contextually appropriate for the period attire."

Step 2: Slice 91 presents the dangerous natural environment (a stormy sea, a struggling swimmer) and ends with a close-up of a hand reaching out of the water for help. Logic holds because the slices depict a progression from an urgent indoor escape to peril at sea, with the final danger being imminent drowning.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows intense indoor scenes with characters in distress, including a man being physically restrained. Clip 2 transitions to a dark, stormy sea at night with a ship in peril and people running on a beach, indicating an escape to a dangerous natural environment.

Step 2: Slice 41 shows a gun pointed across a dining table, escalating interpersonal conflict. Step 3: Slice 22 shows a chase through a factory and into the street/forest. Conclusion: Weaponized conflict plausibly drives characters into flight and pursuit.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 41 shows an indoor confrontation at a table where a gun is pointed at a seated man, clearly establishing a weapon-centered conflict. Step 2: Slice 15 depicts another indoor confrontation with a gun in a factory setting and then transitions to an elegant room with tense conversation/possible negotiation, reinforcing themes of power dynamics and conflict. Step 3: Slice 22 presents a high-stakes chase through a factory and into streets/forest, showing urgent flight through industrial spaces. Logic holds because the evidence includes multiple indoor, weapon-related confrontations (Slices 41 and 15) and a subsequent urgent chase through industrial environments (Slice 22). The answer’s phrasing that these confrontations are followed by a chase and that this suggests negotiations breaking down into pursuit aligns with the progression and tension described, without relying on external details.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a tense indoor scene with a man holding a large knife over a child at a table, indicating a weaponized confrontation. Clip 2 shows another tense indoor scene with three men at a table, one looking alarmed, suggesting a breakdown in negotiation. Clip 3 visually confirms the consequence: rapid movement through industrial spaces (a factory), a chase sequence down an alley, and urgent running through streets, directly following the earlier conflicts."

Step 3: Slice 57 (Scene 2) places her in an elegant drawing room (a private sitting room), seated on a couch with the dog, engaged in a conversation with a man, which matches the private sitting-room conversation. Logic holds because the consistent visual attributes (white dress, small white dog) track her across outdoor, indoor, and drawing room settings.",
