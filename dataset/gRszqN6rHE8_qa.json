Step 2: Slice 25 shows the man in a car holding a sandwich and smiling, indicating a similar handheld meal (a sandwich) in the car. Logic holds because both scenes involve a sandwich, matching the foods asked for.",

In Video 2, the same man is seated in a car and is handed, then eats, what appears to be a smaller sandwich or possibly a waffle (as indicated by the subtitle 'Do you want a waffle?'), but visually it is a handheld bread item consistent with a sandwich. The context of eating a handheld meal in both scenes supports the answer."
