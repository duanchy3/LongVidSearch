Step 2: Slice 60 describes an outdoor scene with a young man on the phone wearing a yellow-and-black striped shirt.

Step 2: Slice 30 depicts three individuals in a small room with blue walls, engaged in discussion and reviewing notes, indicating a collaborative setting. Step 3: Slice 40 also shows three people in the same type of room with equipment and cables, suggesting coordinated work, likely preparation. Logic holds because the context clearly shifts from a solitary grooming scene to a multi-person indoor collaborative environment.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a single man from a low angle, looking up at a mirror and running his hands through his hair, indicating a personal grooming moment. Clips 2 and 3 show the same man, now kneeling on the floor in a hallway, writing on a clipboard while two other individuals stand behind him, observing and holding equipment or notes. This visual shift confirms the transition from a solo grooming activity to a collaborative preparation setting."

Step 2: Slice 54 shows an outdoor scene in front of a house with beige siding and a window, where a person performs an energetic flip, emphasizing a lively atmosphere. Logic holds because the environment clearly shifts from an indoor, calm bedroom setting by a window to an outdoor, energetic house-front setting by a window. While 'yard' isn't explicitly stated, 'house-front' is, which matches the proposed answer's 'yard/house-front' phrasing.",

Step 3: Slice 82 presents a personalized acknowledgment listing top-tier patrons by name, which fits the 'personalized acknowledgment of supporters at the end.' Logic holds because the proposed answer describes moving from the graduation scenes to a general thank-you and then to a patron-specific thank-you, all of which are explicitly depicted in the slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a graduate walking through a gymnasium filled with an audience, clearly depicting a graduation scene. Clip 2 shows a computer monitor displaying the text 'Thank you for watching,' indicating a closing screen.

Step 3: Slice 13 shows a person in the back seat using a smartphone, confirming handheld device use from the back seat viewpoint.
