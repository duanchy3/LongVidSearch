        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 19 states a white goat is reaching up towards a tree, likely eating leaves, indicating the animal feeding from a tree. Step 2: Slice 66 shows a man feeding a goat from his hand at a table. Logic holds because both slices consistently identify a goat performing the described actions in sequence: first feeding from a tree, later being fed by a man.",
        "visual_proof": "In the first clip, a white and brown goat is seen standing on rocks and reaching up to eat leaves from a tree. In the second clip, the same goat approaches a man sitting at a wooden table outdoors, and the man feeds it a cherry from a basket of fruit."

Step 3: Slice 48 shows sausage casing being filled and arranged into a spiral on a round metal tray. Conclusion: The workflow shifts from skewered kebabs to a spiral sausage on a tray.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slices 41 and 43 describe the man shaping ground meat around skewers to make kebabs. Step 2: Slice 48 describes the man preparing a spiral-shaped sausage by holding a long sausage casing, filling it with meat, and arranging it into a spiral on a round metal tray. Logic holds because the question asks what action follows making skewered kebabs and results in a separate spiral product on a tray; Slice 48 explicitly shows that action, matching the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows the man forming meat onto skewers. Clip 2 shows him filling a sausage casing with meat mixture. Clip 3 shows him arranging the long, filled sausage in a spiral pattern on a metal tray. The sequence of actions directly supports the original answer."

Step 2: Slice 22 shows the same man outdoors chopping leafy greens/fresh herbs at a table.

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 27 explicitly shows close-up chopping of green bell peppers. Step 2: Slice 30 again shows close-up chopping of green bell peppers, reinforcing that bell peppers are repeatedly cut. Step 3: Slice 39 shows a mixed bowl containing rice, meat, and vegetables, including bell peppers (noted as red). While the color differs, the vegetable category (bell peppers) matches across slices. Therefore, the prepared vegetable repeatedly cut in close-up and later shown in the mixed bowl is bell peppers, with the close-up specifically featuring green bell peppers.",
        "visual_proof": "Clips 1 and 2 show a person repeatedly chopping green bell peppers in close-up on a wooden board. Clip 3 shows the chopped green bell peppers being added to a large bowl that already contains rice, ground meat, and other vegetables, confirming they are part of the final mixed dish."

Conclusion: The narrative alternates between flora, fauna in the rural setting, and culminating aerial landscapes.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 18 shows close-up nature shots of a white flower, establishing the flower imagery and an outdoor, mountainous setting. Step 2: Slice 71 explicitly transitions from a close-up of a container with white flowers to a playful dog in a grassy outdoor area, directly connecting flowers to an animal scene. Slice 66 adds another animal scene with a goat in a similar outdoor, mountainous environment, reinforcing the shift to animals. Step 3: Slice 88 presents sweeping aerial views of a lush mountainous landscape, providing the final transition to broad mountain views. The sequence described in the proposed answer (flowers → animals → aerial mountain views) aligns with these slices.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 ends with a close-up of white wild roses. Clip 2 shows a man interacting with goats in a grassy, rural area with stone walls, consistent with the background in Clip 1. Clip 3 features a dog in the same grassy field, with a goat visible in the background, confirming the shared environment. Clip 4 provides a wide, aerial shot of the same lush, green, mountainous landscape seen in the background of the previous clips, completing the visual narrative from micro to macro."
