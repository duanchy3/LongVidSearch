        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 35 states the person seasoning raw meat is wearing a blue shirt. Step 2: Slice 92 states the man eating at the table is wearing a blue shirt. Logic holds because the same clothing item (blue shirt) is consistently associated with the individual preparing meat and later eating, helping identify him.",

In Video 2, the same man is shown eating the prepared meal at the table, and he is still wearing the identical blue t-shirt, which serves as a consistent identifier across both scenes."

Step 3: Slice 82 shows the meat being unwrapped from a plastic bag and aluminum foil, indicating the post-cook unwrapping. Step 4: Slice 84 shows the meat being carved on a wooden cutting board, confirming the final slicing/carving for serving.

The action in Slice 11 (picking and examining a purple flower) precedes and aligns as the earlier flower-related moment. Therefore, the context supports the proposed answer.",

Step 3: Slice 72 shows a white dog with black markings on its face and ears resting calmly on a lawn in a similar rural/mountainous environment.
