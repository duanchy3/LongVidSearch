        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 25 explicitly states that the function SM(x,y) is defined as exp(x^T y) and notes a red circle around this equation, marking it as central. Step 2: Evidence Slice 34 discusses a lemma introducing positive random features for the soft-max function, and says it defines SM(x,y) via an expectation to enable unbiased estimators. Step 3: The two slices together indicate that the circled softmax-kernel definition is SM(x,y) = exp(x^T y, and the lemma later presents an expectation-based representation of that same SM kernel for unbiased positive random feature approximations.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the equation 'SM(x,y) def= exp(xᵀy)' is explicitly circled in red. In Video 2, Lemma 1 is presented with the heading '(Positive Random Features (PRFs) for Softmax)', and its first formula begins with 'SM(x,y) = E[...]'. This shows that the lemma provides an expectation-based representation for the same kernel, SM(x,y), which was previously defined and circled."
