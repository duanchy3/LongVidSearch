        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 19 presents interior choir stalls in St. John's Cathedral, establishing the cathedral context. Step 2: Slice 20 includes an on-screen text overlay stating \"THERE ARE 95 DIFFERENT GARGOYLES ON ST. JOHN'S,\" directly providing the count of gargoyles for that cathedral. Logic holds because the segment transitions from interior elements (choir stalls) to exterior details (gargoyles) of the same cathedral, and the specific number is explicitly stated.",
        "visual_proof": "The second video clip, at timestamp 0:01-0:04, displays a close-up of moss-covered gargoyles on the cathedral's exterior. Superimposed on this image is the text: 'THERE ARE 95 DIFFERENT GARGOYLES ON ST. JOHN'S'. This directly provides the specific count mentioned in the question."

        "question": "A sequence introduces official indulgence documents, then shows a portrait of Martin Luther. What historical controversy is suggested by placing these two elements back-to-back?",

Step 2: Slice 67 shows Martin Luther’s portrait (1529), a key Reformation figure known for opposing indulgence sales. Step 3: Slice 71 continues religious-historical themes of suffering and belief. Conclusion: The juxtaposition implies the indulgence controversy that helped spark the Reformation.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 66 presents official indulgence documents and a market scene explicitly showing indulgences being sold, emphasizing their historical practice and significance. Step 2: Slice 67 presents a portrait of Martin Luther and identifies him as a key figure in the Protestant Reformation. Logic holds because juxtaposing the sale of indulgences with Martin Luther, known in the context as a Reformation leader, suggests the controversy surrounding indulgences that was central to Reformation critiques, thereby aligning with the proposed answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 visually presents an official document labeled 'INDULGENCES' with multiple seals, representing the Church's practice. Clip 2 immediately follows with a portrait of 'MARTIN LUTHER', explicitly identifying him. The juxtaposition of these two distinct visual elements—a symbol of Church doctrine (indulgences) and the figure who famously challenged it (Luther)—strongly suggests the historical controversy of his critique, which was a catalyst for the Protestant Reformation."

Step 2: Slice 12 includes a blurred image labeled \"S'HERTOGENBOSCH 1450,\" linking the city contextually to Bosch.
