Step 2: Slice 8 describes heavy snowfall with '2-4 INCHES PER HOUR' and visuals of falling snow on a snowy road, indicating snow is descending from the sky during a blizzard.

Step 3: Slice 33 shows the studio segment with an anchor and a screen reading 'BREAKING NEWS: THREE NORTHERN SOUTHERN TRAINS COLLIDE,' summarizing the incident as breaking news. Logic holds because the field footage (Slices 34 and 35) provides the on-the-ground visuals and response, while the studio segment (Slice 33) presents the concise headline summary. The 'Northern Southern' naming is likely VLM noise; the event clearly matches Norfolk Southern from the field slices.",
