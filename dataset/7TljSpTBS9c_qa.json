Step 2: Slice 72 describes close-up shots and touch focusing on a colorful quilt on a bed, highlighting it earlier in the video. The logic holds because Slice 81 confirms the self-care item (Epsom salts) and also references the bed with a colorful quilt, while Slice 72 focuses on that quilt through touch and close-ups, matching the 'nearby bedroom item' description.",
