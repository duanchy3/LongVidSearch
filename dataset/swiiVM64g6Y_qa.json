Step 2: Evidence Slice 42 shows a demographics graphic stating \"48 million\" for Spain's population. Logic holds because the first number matches the early Spanish-speaking statistic and the second matches the later Spain population statistic.",

Step 2: Slice 48 shows the text 'Ladino (Sephardic Jews)', naming Ladino as a distinct language associated with Sephardic Jews.

Step 2: Evidence Slice 74 describes a later segment featuring a poster for 'Juana La Loca,' presented as a historical drama. Logic holds because the question asks for one joint Spanish/Mexican film and the historical drama shown later, which are directly supported by the two slices.",
