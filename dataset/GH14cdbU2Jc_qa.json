Step 2: Evidence Slice 40 shows a tense, investigative-feeling scene in a café where a man in a blue shirt hands a small object, possibly a card or piece of paper, to another man. Logic holds because both slices explicitly depict the exchange of a small paper/card-like item in serious, investigative contexts, one in an office and another in a similar tense setting.",

In the second clip (0:02-0:03), a man at a table in a cafe setting is seen handing a similar-looking white, rectangular object with a pattern on it to another man across the table. The visual evidence confirms that a small paper/card-like item is exchanged in both the office and the cafe settings."
