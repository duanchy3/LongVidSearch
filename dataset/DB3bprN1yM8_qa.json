Step 2: Slice 23 shows an exterior shot of an Apple store with the overlay text \"APPLE'S DOUBLE TROUBLE,\" meaning the storefront is labeled as having double trouble. Logic holds because both references clearly and explicitly identify Apple in the described contexts.",

In Clip 2, a later scene shows an Apple store with the large yellow Apple logo on its glass facade, accompanied by the headline 'APPLE'S DOUBLE TROUBLE'. This visually confirms that Apple is the company referenced in both contexts."

Step 3: Slice 20 explicitly states that equipment costs are higher for 800V EVs, again labeled Bloomberg Green.

Step 3: Slice 75 delivers breaking news that the BOJ hiked rates and scrapped YCC, explicitly stating the policy shift and the new rate range. Step 4: Slice 76 reinforces the policy-change narrative with market reaction (USD/JPY) and further BOJ actions (ending ETF and J-REIT purchases).

Clip 3 features a news anchor announcing 'BOJ HIKES, SCRAPS YCC' and 'BOJ SETS POLICY RATE IN RANGE BETWEEN 0% TO 0.1%', which is the breaking policy shift. The sequence visually connects the economic conditions (inflation, wages) to the central bank's response."

Step 2: Slice 5 presents Apple's response to a DOJ antitrust lawsuit with on-screen text 'APPLE: LAWSUIT IS WRONG ON THE FACTS,' detailing DOJ suing Apple and allegations.

Step 2: Slice 12 shows a text overlay stating 'IMF Approves $880M for Ukraine' over a nighttime shopping street, again explicitly indicating financial support for Ukraine.
