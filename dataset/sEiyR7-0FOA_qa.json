        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 16 states the black title card reads \"DID POLISH CAVALRY CHARGE AT TANKS IN WWII?\", which matches the myth-question in the proposed answer. Step 2: Slice 21 describes a 1939 newspaper clipping about Polish cavalry charging German Panzers, which constitutes historical evidence shown in the video. Despite minor sequencing wording (both slices say \"begins\"), the content clearly supports the answer.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with a black title card displaying the exact text: 'DID POLISH CAVALRY CHARGE AT TANKS IN WWII?'. Clip 2 then shows a stylized, newspaper-like graphic with the year '1939' and the headline 'POLISH CAVALRY CHARGE GERMAN PANZERS', which serves as the historical evidence presented in the video."

Conclusion: The framing suggests the myth is contrasted with infantry engagement preceding armored involvement.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 15 shows a wide shot where multiple tanks advance while a cavalry charge continues toward them, creating the dramatic cavalry-versus-tanks imagery. Step 2: Slice 20 shows the cavalry engaging German infantry positioned behind sandbags (Scene 2), and only later introduces German armored vehicles (Scene 4). Logic holds because the first depiction frames the myth (cavalry vs tanks), while the later scene clarifies the cavalry actually fought infantry before armor appeared.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 opens with a close-up of a German tank with a swastika, immediately followed by Polish cavalrymen on horseback brandishing sabers, establishing the myth's imagery. Clip 2 then shows Polish cavalry charging not at tanks, but at German infantry positioned behind sandbags in a forest clearing. Only after this charge does the scene cut to German armored cars arriving, confirming the sequence described in the answer."

Step 3: Slice 68 depicts a formal meeting around a large table with a map labeled North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos—Southeast Asia—used in strategic discussion.

Conclusion: The video links combat, loss narratives, and memorial symbolism.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 11 depicts WWI trench warfare with soldiers operating artillery, marching in trenches, and a bleak, harsh battlefield environment. While it doesn't explicitly say 'sacrifice,' it emphasizes the harsh realities and gravity of war, supporting the theme of soldiers' costly experiences. Step 2: Slice 40 explicitly centers on the Gallipoli campaign and is titled 'The Vanished Battalion of Gallipoli,' concluding with a somber reflection on loss and the heavy toll, directly supporting soldier sacrifice. Step 3: Slice 8 shows a red poppy symbolizing remembrance and hope, explicitly tied to remembering those fallen in conflict. Logic holds because the trench warfare imagery (Slice 11), the Gallipoli narrative with loss/sacrifice (Slice 40), and the red poppy commemoration (Slice 8) collectively support the motif of soldier sacrifice and remembrance. Although Slice 11 doesn’t explicitly mention casualties, its depiction of the brutal conditions of trench warfare aligns with the sacrifice theme, and Slice 8 explicitly covers remembrance.",
