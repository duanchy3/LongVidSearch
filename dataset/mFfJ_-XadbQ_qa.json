        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 10 describes a presenter in a bright yellow T-shirt with an aerial inset labeled 'Gorée island.' Step 2: Slice 37 states that later, beside the guest Malick on a plain blue background, an image of Gorée Island appears. The same island appears in both contexts, matching the question’s sequence.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, an aerial image of an island with the text 'Gorée island' is displayed as an inset while the presenter in the yellow shirt speaks. In Clip 2, the same aerial image of the island, now labeled 'Gorée', appears as an inset next to the guest speaker, Malick, against a blue background."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 36 explicitly states that 'Teranga' appears prominently and is a Wolof term meaning hospitality, introduced by the woman speaker (Ndey). Step 2: Slice 41 shows a yellow-shirt presenter discussing the Wolof language and clarifying its pronunciation ('Wolof,' not 'wolf'), tying the context to Wolof terminology. Logic holds because the cultural value introduced ('Teranga') is identified as a key Wolof term in Slice 36, and Slice 41 connects the discussion to Wolof language, supporting the identification of the term.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the woman speaker, identified as 'Ndey', explicitly introduces the term 'Teranga' via on-screen text while speaking. In Clip 2, the man in the yellow shirt discusses the Wolof language, with a speech bubble displaying 'Wolof' and an image of a wolf crossed out to clarify pronunciation. The connection between the two clips is established by the shared context of discussing Wolof culture and language, where 'Teranga' was introduced as a key cultural value by the first speaker and the second speaker later clarifies aspects of the Wolof language itself."

Step 2: Slice 32 shows a dish image while the purple-shirt presenter discusses the meal (jollof-like). Step 3: Slice 33 shows the yellow-shirt presenter comparing Nigeria (jollof rice) and Senegal food with flags and dishes. Conclusion: The connected food topic is jollof rice and Senegal’s related dishes (Thiebou dienne/Thiebou Yap).",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 31 explicitly shows the purple-shirt presenter introducing Senegalese dishes including Thiebou dienne / Thiebou Yap, labeled as Jolof (Jollof) rice. Step 2: Slice 32 further supports that the purple-shirt presenter is discussing a dish that appears to be jollof rice. Step 3: Slice 33 shows the yellow-shirt presenter comparing Nigerian and Senegalese cuisines; the image for Nigeria appears to be jollof rice, and he points to the Senegal flag and another dish, indicating a comparison between the two countries' cuisines. Given that jollof rice is explicitly introduced for Senegal earlier and is visibly a focal dish for Nigeria in the comparison, the Senegalese food topic is Jollof rice (Thiebou dienne / Thiebou Yap).",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the purple-shirt presenter introduces Senegalese cuisine with visuals of Fadiouth Shell Island and then displays a dish labeled 'Thièbou dienne / Thiebou Yap (Jolof rice)'. In Clip 3, the yellow-shirt presenter stands next to a Senegalese flag and an image of the same dish (Thiebou dienne), visually linking it to the comparison with Nigerian cuisine shown in previous frames."

In the second clip (0:01-0:02), he is again shown holding the same white mug with the green logo while pouring from a coffee pot, immediately before the video transitions to an inset image of two men with guitars."

Step 3: Slice 50 describes the later ethnic-group explanation segment where the presenter is again wearing a yellow T-shirt. The visual attributes (yellow shirt/T-shirt, similar backdrop) consistently link the host across these segments, regardless of naming variations.",

In Clip 2, he is in the same yellow shirt while holding a mug and speaking. In Clip 3, he continues to wear the yellow T-shirt while discussing ethnic groups like Wolof and Serer/Fula, confirming the consistent clothing color throughout the segments."
