        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 41 explicitly states that a traditional brass samovar is being used to prepare tea, with a teapot placed under the spout to fill with hot water for brewing. Step 2: Slice 45 describes a man pouring tea from an ornate teapot into a glass cup at a table. Logic holds because Slice 41 establishes tea preparation via the brass samovar, and Slice 45 shows the tea being poured into a glass cup, matching the question’s sequence.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, hot water is poured from the brass samovar into a glass teapot containing dark tea leaves. In Clip 2, the same glass teapot, now filled with a dark red liquid (brewed tea), is placed on top of the samovar to keep warm, and the man is seen drinking from a small glass cup, which is consistent with the traditional method of serving tea from a samovar."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 58 describes a man at a picnic table feeding a dog a piece of fruit. Step 2: Slice 59 describes a person feeding a goat grapes by hand. Logic holds because the two slices clearly identify the animals (dog and goat) and the feeding contexts (picnic table fruit and hand-fed grapes).",

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 23 states that the person is washing vegetables at an outdoor sink, specifically eggplants and tomatoes. Step 2: Slice 53 shows eggplants skewered beside whole chickens during grilling. Logic holds because the vegetable identified in the washing scene (eggplants) is the same vegetable shown later skewered next to the chickens.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, eggplants are visibly washed in the outdoor stone sink. In Clip 2, the same type of eggplants are shown skewered vertically on metal rods alongside whole seasoned chickens, ready for grilling. This directly links the washed vegetable to the one appearing on the skewer."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 3 states the man fills the barrel with dry branches and twigs, packing them tightly. Step 2: Slice 51 describes the barrel being used as a cooking setup with fire visible through gaps between branches, indicating branches are the fuel for the fire. Logic holds because the only material explicitly packed into the barrel earlier is dry branches/twigs, and the later scene explicitly mentions branches associated with the fire that cooks the chickens.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, the man is seen gathering and placing dry branches/twigs into the blue barrel after modifying it with a metal frame. In Clip 2, the same barrel is shown in use as a cooking pit with chickens hanging around it, and flames are visibly rising from within the barrel, indicating that the previously placed wood has been ignited to create the fire for cooking."

Step 2: Slice 20 states the chicken pieces have been seasoned with red sauce, and the man rubs this sauce into the chicken. Logic holds because both stages explicitly identify the sauce as red.",
