    "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 5 explicitly states that once a peak reaches high enough into the atmosphere, glaciers begin to form and slowly carve at the summit, indicating an atmospheric process that limits peak height. Step 2: Evidence Slice 4 states that mountains are very heavy and cause the underlying crust to bend and sag like a trampoline, which lowers the peak, and further notes that the weight can overpower uplift, clearly describing downward bending of the crust under heavy mountains as a limiting factor. Logic holds because the proposed answer names these two processes—glacial carving and crustal sagging—as the mechanisms limiting mountain height, directly matching the text in the slices.",
    "visual_proof": "Clip 1 (0:26-0:31) shows text stating 'ONCE A PEAK REACHES HIGH ENOUGH INTO THE ATMOSPHERE GLACIERS BEGIN TO FORM WHICH THEN SLOWLY CARVE AT THE SUMMIT'. Clip 2 (0:01-0:09) shows text stating 'MOUNTAINS ARE REALLY HEAVY, AND THAT MASS CAUSES THE UNDERLYING CRUST TO BEND & SAG... WHICH LOWERS THE PEAK SOMWHAT'.
