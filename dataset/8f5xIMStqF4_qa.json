Step 2: Evidence Slice 36 explicitly mentions an article titled 'MetNet-2: Deep Learning for 12-Hour Precipitation Forecasting' from Google Research, identifying the weather-forecasting model as MetNet-2. Therefore, the name of the weather model is directly supported by the context.",

Step 2: Slice 51 describes a project with text overlay 'AI learns to drive Mario Kart 64 on real hardware,' and shows an AI controlling Mario Kart 64 on a physical Nintendo 64, which is a classic racing game.
