        "reasoning_chain": "Step 1: Slice 18 shows butter placed over cold water to keep it from melting. Step 2: Slice 38 shows butter transferred into a bowl of flour (building the dough base). Step 3: Slice 41 shows rose water added and folded into the dough. Step 4: Slice 42 shows the dough being shaped and cut into uniform pieces. Conclusion: Cooling butter preserves texture, then it’s mixed into flour, flavored with rose water, and shaped.",
        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 18 shows butter being placed in a bowl set over cold water with an overlay \"to keep from melting place over cold water,\" supporting the claim that the butter is kept cool. Step 2: Slice 38 shows the butter being scooped and mixed into a larger bowl of flour, supporting incorporation of butter into flour as part of building the dough. Step 3: Slice 41 shows rose water being added and folded into the dough, supporting flavoring the dough. Step 4: Slice 42 shows shaping and cutting the dough with a metal cup, supporting the final shaping/cutting step. The logical chain from keeping butter cool to incorporating it into flour, flavoring with rose water, and shaping is fully supported.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows butter being placed in a bowl over cold water to prevent melting. Clip 2 shows the butter being added to a flour mixture. Clip 3 visually confirms the addition of 'rose water' to the dough as text appears on screen while it's being mixed. Clip 4 shows the finished dough being portioned and shaped, confirming the sequence."
