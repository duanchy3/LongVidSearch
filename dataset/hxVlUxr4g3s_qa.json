        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 10 states that on the prep table there are various ingredients, including fruits like watermelons and pineapples, indicating watermelon is present early on. Step 2: Slice 79 describes an outdoor sequence where a person skillfully cuts a large watermelon into neat slices, making watermelon the focus. Logic holds because the fruit noted early (watermelon) is the same one later highlighted during slicing.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1 (0:00-0:02), a whole watermelon is clearly visible on the wooden prep table next to the meat. In Video 2 (0:00-0:07), the same type of green-striped watermelon is shown being cut into neat slices on an outdoor wooden board, confirming it is the fruit that appears in both contexts."

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 86 describes a black-and-white dog resting on a grassy lawn. Step 2: Slice 88 shows a close-up of a dog with a white coat and black patches chewing on a stick. Logic holds because both slices depict the same animal (a black-and-white dog) first resting and later chewing a stick, matching the query's description. The specific mention of a cooking/eating storyline does not affect the identification of the animal.",
        "visual_proof": "In both clips, a dog with distinct black and white fur is visible. In Clip 1, the dog is lying on grass in a garden setting, appearing to rest while holding a stick. In Clip 2, a close-up shows the same dog actively chewing on the stick. The consistent markings and behavior confirm it’s the same black-and-white dog across both scenes."

Step 2: Slice 91 shows boys sitting around a table eating slices of watermelon. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention watermelon being prepared and then eaten at tables in group settings.",

In the second clip, the same boys are shown sitting at the table eating large slices of watermelon.

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 7 explicitly states there are overlays of a smartphone screen showing a Google search and product page for a premium Damascus chef knife, indicating subtle promotion of that tool. Step 2: Slice 77 describes a smartphone displaying a food-related app with various cuts of meat while the person slices cooked meat. The proposed answer reflects both: it identifies the Damascus chef knife as the promoted tool and notes the later appearance of a food-related app on a phone screen.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, a phone screen is overlaid showing the 'homewild.shop' website with a search for 'Damascus Chef Knife' and an 'ADD TO CART' button. In Video 2, another phone screen overlay appears showing the same website but focused on different kitchenware items while the man slices cooked meat. The visual evidence confirms the subtle promotion of kitchen tools via smartphone overlays during both raw seasoning and cooked slicing phases."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 31 shows a man later pouring oil into a wok to start cooking in a similar rustic outdoor kitchen setting. Logic holds because Slice 2 provides the ingredient (garlic) and the action (crushing into paste), and Slice 31 establishes the subsequent cooking step (pouring oil). The setting continuity supports the sequence without requiring exact identity matching.",
        "visual_proof": "In the first clip, the man is shown placing whole garlic cloves into a wooden mortar and then using a pestle to crush them into a paste. This action occurs before the second clip, where he pours oil into a wok. The visual sequence clearly establishes that garlic is the ingredient crushed prior to adding oil."

Step 2: Evidence Slice 31 describes a transition from the cooking scene to yellow squash blossoms and explicitly mentions that a bee is seen visiting one of the blossoms, collecting nectar. Logic holds because the same animal (bee) is identified in both contexts: garden flowers and yellow squash blossoms near the cooking scene.",
        "visual_proof": "In Clip 1, a bee is clearly visible on a pink zinnia flower at 0:05 and again at 0:10. In Clip 2, a similar insect, identifiable as a bee by its shape and behavior, is shown inside a yellow squash blossom at 0:09-0:10. The visual evidence across both clips confirms the presence of a bee in both locations."

Step 2: Slice 45 shows a hose spraying water onto a smoldering, charred pile, indicating active control/extinguishing of the fire. Step 3: Slice 40 depicts a man cooking a pot of yellow rice and vegetables and adding water, showing the rice dish continuing to cook afterward. The proposed answer matches these later evidences: hose-sprayed smoldering pile and the rice-and-vegetable pot continuing to cook with added water.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 shows a fire being started in a pit. Clip 2 visually confirms the smoldering embers are being sprayed with water from a hose, indicating active control of the fire. Clip 3 then shows a man adding water to a large pot containing what appears to be a rice-and-vegetable dish (likely bulgur or couscous with peppers), which is being cooked on an outdoor stove, confirming the continuation of cooking after the fire was managed."

Step 4: Slice 39 shows a vegetable mixture in the large pot (tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and other ingredients) and the addition of yellow rice to this pot, supporting that the cooked vegetable base is combined into a rice-and-vegetable mixture.
