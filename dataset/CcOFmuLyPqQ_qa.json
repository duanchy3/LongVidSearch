        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 44 explicitly shows a map of London with a green area labeled 'Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)' and a price of £12.50 per day, establishing a policy presented with a monetary cost on a map. Step 2: Slice 71 describes a segment about net-zero targets and later shows an outdoor scene featuring a roadside sign for the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), indicating the policy appears again as part of the net-zero segment. Logic holds because both slices reference ULEZ in the specified contexts.",
        "visual_proof": "In Video 1, the map at 0:01 explicitly labels the green highlighted zone as 'Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)' and displays a cost of '£12.50 a day' at 0:03. In Video 2, at 0:00, a roadside sign with the ULEZ logo (a red circle with a car icon) is visible, indicating restrictions for vehicles not meeting emission standards, which ties into the broader context of net-zero targets shown later in the same clip with the UK Parliament document on net zero."

Step 2: Slice 21 describes a studio poster behind a seated presenter that features an image of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament.

In Video 2, at timestamp 0:02, a poster is taped to the blue studio wall behind the presenter; this poster features a black-and-white image that prominently displays the same landmark, Big Ben, as part of its design."
