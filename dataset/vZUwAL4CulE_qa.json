        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Evidence Slice 2 explicitly states, \"The video begins with a group of graduates dressed in red gowns...\" establishing that the graduates celebrating occurs at the start. Step 2: Evidence Slice 25 describes a sequence beginning with a man and then a young boy running into a trampoline park; it does not state that this occurs before the graduates segment or provide any linkage to contradict Slice 2's ordering. Step 3: Given the explicit 'begins with' phrasing in Slice 2 and no explicit evidence that the boy runs in before the graduates, the logic supports that the graduates celebrating happens first.",
        "visual_proof": "The first clip (ID: 2) visually depicts graduates in red gowns on a stage, with one raising his arms and others walking behind him. The second clip (ID: 25) shows a young boy in an orange shirt and yellow shorts running through an indoor facility, which is identified as a trampoline park later in the clip. Since these are time-sliced clips from the same continuous source video, the event shown in Clip 1 (graduation celebration) occurs chronologically before the event shown in Clip 2 (boy running into the trampoline park)."

Step 2: Slice 20 says a man giving a thumbs-up beside a car also has a white towel draped over his shoulder. Logic holds because both slices explicitly mention the same item—a white towel—draped over the man's shoulder, satisfying the query about the clothing item seen in both contexts, regardless of minor outfit differences.",

In Video 2 (0:00-0:01), the same man, identifiable by his facial features and black t-shirt, is seen giving a thumbs-up beside a car while still wearing the same white towel over his shoulder."

Step 2: Slice 1 states early in the video there is a black screen with white text reading 'NEW SEEK DISCOMFORT DROP OUT NOW' and a website address. Logic holds because both slices describe black screen promos featuring the Seek Discomfort brand and a website, matching the answer's identification of an early title card with the same brand and website context.",

This is followed by the website \"seekdiscomfort.com\" appearing on a black screen at 0:12-0:13.

        "logic_check_reasoning": "Step 1: Slice 91 explicitly shows the phrase \"Part 2 coming soon...\" on a black screen, which directly serves as a teaser for future content. Step 2: Slice 93 shows a promotional message \"Seek Discomfort drop out for 72 Hours only\" and the website \"seekdiscomfort.com\" remaining until the end, along with product visuals, clearly indicating brand promotion. Logic holds because the first is a teaser card and the later is a promotional end card; both elements are explicitly supported by the slices provided. The mention of a beach incident is not evidenced here, but the answer does not rely on that detail beyond identifying the teaser phrase.",
        "visual_proof": "Clip 1 ends with the text 'Part 2 coming soon...' on a black screen after showing a man in an office and another in a hallway. Clip 2 begins with black screens and then displays promotional content for 'Seek Discomfort drop out for 72 Hours only' alongside clothing items and the URL 'seekdiscomfort.com'. The first text is a narrative teaser, and the second is a commercial promotion, confirming the relationship described."

Step 3: Slice 85 shows a later indoor scene labeled 'Monday Morning' with a man speaking vlog-style in front of a vibrant yellow wall, which aligns with the 'later indoor scene' description.
